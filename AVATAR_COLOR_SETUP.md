# Enhanced Avatar System Setup

## Database Update Required

To enable the avatar features, you need to add a new column to your `user_profiles` table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE user_profiles ADD COLUMN avatar_color VARCHAR(7) DEFAULT '#3B82F6';
```

This will add an `avatar_color` field that stores hex color codes (like #3B82F6) for custom avatar colors.

## Features Added

### 1. **Clean Avatar-Only Header**
- Removed name and role text from the header
- Shows only a clean avatar/icon with dropdown arrow
- Hover effects and smooth transitions

### 2. **File Upload System** ðŸ†•
- **Direct Upload**: Users can upload images directly from their devices
- **Drag & Drop**: Intuitive drag-and-drop interface
- **File Validation**: Checks file type (images only) and size (max 5MB)
- **Base64 Storage**: Images are converted to base64 and stored in the database
- **Live Preview**: See uploaded image immediately
- **Remove Option**: Easy removal with hover button

### 3. **Custom Avatar Color Picker**
- Color picker input for custom colors
- 8 predefined color options (Blue, Green, Purple, Amber, Red, Cyan, Lime, Orange)
- Live preview of avatar color changes
- Only shows when no profile picture is set

### 4. **Smart Color System**
- Uses custom `avatar_color` if set
- Falls back to role-based colors (Blue for students, Green for teachers, Purple for parents)
- Consistent across header avatar and dropdown

### 5. **Enhanced User Experience**
- Cleaner, more modern interface
- Better visual hierarchy
- Smooth animations and hover effects
- Responsive design
- Multiple upload options (file upload + URL input)

## How It Works

1. **Default State**: Shows role-based colored avatar with initials
2. **Edit Profile**: User can:
   - Upload image from device (drag & drop or click to choose)
   - Enter image URL
   - Choose custom avatar color
3. **File Upload**: 
   - Validates file type and size
   - Converts to base64 for storage
   - Shows live preview
4. **Profile Picture**: If image is provided, shows image instead of colored initials
5. **Fallback**: If image fails to load, falls back to custom color or role color

## Upload Options

### Option 1: File Upload
