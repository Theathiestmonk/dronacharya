They deployed Scratch application to build their projects and used interesting mix of voice-over, text over speech and programming scratch objects for movement. Some glimpses of these beautiful and innocent stories are captured below: https://prakriti.edu.in/wp-content/uploads/MCT-POL-1.mp4\n\n\n\n--- Substack Article ---\nCan We Save the Planet or Should We Save Ourselves? Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts. Click here to read more about MannanA Campus Enriched by Nature's BountyOur landscape is a vibrant testament to our commitment to biodiversity and natural beauty. Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious",

    "main_content": "Films that ‘Tweens’ Should Watch: Prakriti Film Appreciation Club by Prakriti | Jun 25, 2021 We conducted The Creative Film Appreciation workshop over the last 8 weeks and it was an enriching experience for us the facilitators. There were 9 very inquisitive and curious kids in the age range 12-15 years from various parts of the country as participants. We watched 7 films in all from various countries and genres including Where is the Friend’s House?, Children of Heaven, Princess Mononoke, Innocent Moves, My Octopus Teacher, The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind and The Breadwinner. We’d meet every Sunday morning after having watched the film of the week and engage in a circle of sharing and dialogue, dwelling on questions like: What feelings did the film evoke in us? Which characters in the film did we resonate (or not) with and why? If one were the filmmaker, what ending would one have given the film? and the most important question of all, What did we learn about ourselves through the film? It was a joy to listen to the children and their honest and insightful sharing. It left us with a lot of hope for the future of our society with such bright young kids around who will go on to be leaders of tomorrow in their own unique ways. It was a refreshing boost of inspiration for us at the beginning of every week. A big thanks to the nine children of Prakriti and Naveen Vasudevan, the mentor, for creating this platform of fear-free exchange!\n\n\n\n--- Substack Article ---\nCan We Save the Planet or Should We Save Ourselves?

    "main_content": "Language Development through Collective Reading in our Green Group (KG) by Prakriti | Jan 9, 2021 Since the past few weeks, Green Group has been indulging in ‘Shared Reading Activity‘ with the story ‘I Like It When…’ during their English Sessions. Shared Reading Activity started with a ‘Demonstration‘ by the facilitator i.e; reading the story by pointing towards each word with a red pointer. Then, it was time for our young learners to ‘participate’ in the process of reading by making flashcards of some Action Words like splash, peekaboo, hug, tickle and dance. In this picture, Green Group learners had to participate by lifting up their flashcards i.e; whenever they heard/saw their respective Action words, while the story ‘I Like It When…’ was being narrated to them. Later, our learners had some fun playing some games with the Action Words like ‘peekaboo’ where they hid behind their Web Camera and jumped back with an excited “BOO”. They hugged themselves, danced, twirled around on ‘Doo doo doo dooo’, smiled and giggled on imaginary tickles. Sounds fun, right!! Indeed, it was a pleasure to see them enjoying themselves while learning. As a part of Shared Reading Activity, our learners also read the text, by completing the sentences of the story, being read by the facilitator. After enjoying the story, where ‘Little Penguin’ shared how it likes to spend time with its family, our learners too shared their favourite moments spent with their families. Shared Reading activity culminated with ‘Free Art Expression’ by Green Group children where they were completely engrossed in doing their artwork with different art materials of their choice like pencil shavings, leaves, twigs that are found on the ground and so on. Green Group Learners had a lot of fun in the process of learning, together while playing games, listening to a story, expressing themselves through their art. About the author: Ms. Ria Jain and Vineet Swaroop are Green Group facilitators at Prakriti.\n\n\n\n--- Substack Article ---\nCan We Save the Planet or Should We Save Ourselves? Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts. Click here to read more about MannanA Campus Enriched by Nature's BountyOur landscape is a vibrant testament to our commitment to biodiversity and natural beauty. Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious",

From our first batch of 5 learners in 2023 to the following two cohorts with 100+ subject entries, each year has reflected a deepening engagement...\n\n\n\n--- Substack Article ---\nCan We Save the Planet or Should We Save Ourselves? Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts. Click here to read more about MannanA Campus Enriched by Nature's BountyOur landscape is a vibrant testament to our commitment to biodiversity and natural beauty. Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious",

    "main_content": "Remembering Danish Siddiqui by Prakriti | Jul 18, 2021 Danish Siddiqui, father of one of the children at Prakriti and a world-acclaimed photo-journalist is no more today. However, his relentless quest for exposing the truth to raise consciousness of the society will keep him alive with us eternally. He will be a role model of truth seeking, courage and risk-taking for learners, teachers and student activists at Prakriti and other places of education. His soul-stirring photographs will continue to inspire many for purposeful journalism. As a loving father, Danish still made time for a few of the physical events that happened at school during the lockdown. His search for progressive education had brought the family to Prakriti. He had a deep interest in inculcating the connect with the heritage and deep-rooted values of India in his children. Prakriti Learners, parents and facilitators can express their tribute to Danish bhaiya in the school-wide prayer meeting on Wednesday, 21 July at 5PM. May his onward journey be peaceful. May there be peace in the world.\n\n\n\n--- Substack Article ---\nCan We Save the Planet or Should We Save Ourselves?

    "main_content": "Shabd Shala – Elucidating the literary gems of India by Prakriti | Feb 2, 2022 Shabd Shaala is one of a kind of initiative under the aegis of “Project Kabir” to conserve and promote Sufi poetry, written in rich literature in vernacular language from the times of the “Bhakti movement” amongst the school children, in India through music. It also provides for a remarkable opportunity to immerse in the wisdom of saint-poets such as Kabir, Meerabai, Gorakhnath, Ravidas, and Sufis like Bulleh Shah and Ghulam Fareed. In the words of Shabnam Virmani, founder and conceptualizer of the project, “Mystics teach us to interrogate the world and simultaneously to interrogate ourselves; to question our impulse to ‘other’ certain categories of people based on religion, caste, gender or nationality; to recognize our place in nature and learn to be in consonance with it; to recognize the power of being content, rather than consumptive; to know the power of humility rather than self-aggrandisement; and so to cherish ourselves and each moment with an attitude of non-attachment and very importantly, to learn to quieten our monkey minds. The lessons our children could learn are so many!” Though several generations of Indian school children have grown up learning ten Kabir couplets (dohe) as part of their Hindi syllabus, however Shabd Shaala believes song is the best possible pedagogy for sharing the power of this poetry and would bring diverse folk singers from Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan & Kutch into physical or digital classrooms as teachers for children. Additionally, learners would gain an appreciation for the tremendous diversity of folk music traditions, rural cultures, languages, and dialects in which oral pieces of literature thrive in our land. ABOUT “KABIR PROJECT” The true spirit of the Kabir Project lies in the taana-baana (warp & weft) of social networks and friendships built over years between the singers, scholars, activists, artists, students, and the larger public through our work which continues to expand in new and surprising directions, such as teaching, exhibitions, workshops and curricula and the joy of singing itself.‘Kabir Project’ is currently working with a selection of 10 schools across the country to incubate this idea over 6 sessions, Prakriti being one. Shabd Shaala team consisting of Shabnam Virmani, a renowned filmmaker, poetess, writer, and Director at Kabir Projects, and her colleague Sahamata made a short presentation to teachers/parents and students of Prakriti about the idea behind the initiative in the month of January 2022. Here are the excerpts for your viewing.\n\n\n\n--- Substack Article ---\nCan We Save the Planet or Should We Save Ourselves? Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts. Click here to read more about MannanA Campus Enriched by Nature's BountyOur landscape is a vibrant testament to our commitment to biodiversity and natural beauty. Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious",

    "main_content": "Personal ProjectsPurpose of a personal project is to build an ecosystem for the child for independent learning. As we know that learning is most joyful when it is aligned with the interests of the child. As adults some of us are clear about our passions today but for some who are not, they are advised to go back to their childhood days and remember and think about what they enjoyed the most. Thus, the purity of childhood is the best time to explore one’s passions.

For some children it could be furthering what their known interests and while for others it could be something they are curious about and want to build their knowledge on. The mentor should encourage the learner to think of a topic for a personal project and facilitate a process of self-discovery by asking them the following fundamental questions. Why is the idea personal to you? The idea should be something that the learner is deeply motivated about. What is the challenge in this idea? The project should be that which requires aliet of efforts in achieving from where the learner is today. How will I go about learning in this project? There should be a plan such as consulting people, reading resources or visiting places for gaining information or learning a skill for mastery. How will you demonstrate your learning? There should be a plan to showcase learning by way of a presentation of learning of a product or a piece of writing say, or even a demonstration of dance where the process of learning can be journaled and presented. Self reflection The ultimate objective of a personal project is to develop meta-cognition skills. The learner should be able to reflect their ability to learn independently, managing time, overcoming difficulties and collaborating with the mentor. Few example of personal projects and products for POL are: Exploring varieties of rocks and minerals found around us and presenting the collection or sketches with explanation; Developing a blog for children’s books to review and sharing the public blog; Writing a photo essay and publishing it in a children’s magazine and demonstrating the literature; Helping underprivileged children (such as Janwaar community with English & Maths skills online; and showcasing the session recording Learning a new dance form and writing on the beauty dancers express through it.\n\n\n\n--- Substack Article ---\nCan We Save the Planet or Should We Save Ourselves?

Art is deeper, art has many facets! Art is ceremonial and our history is full of evidences. Art is functional, every chair you sit on , every wall frame you look at serves a purpose.The heritage of traditional art forms are the narrative side of art, bringing in with them centuries old tales handed down not in words but as sculptures of Ajanta and Ellora and likes. And lastly but most radically, art is persuasive.It has the ability to influence behaviors, alter attitudes and impact society at large. It is the mirror of the changing times of a generation with a language of it’s own.With the potential of such ardent impact ,art cannot be treated as an alien entity but as a vital , parallel system of communications. It should be pivoted to intersect with other disciplines flawlessly. At Prakriti we intentionally interpolate varied disciplines with art to help our learners visualize their everyday lives through self expression and reflection. After all, the human brain is wired to notice and respond to visual stimuli. Our iterative process in art enables learners to envision, create, present and respond to their understanding of the world around them structurally and conceptually. In the words of our Art Mentor, Meera George (https://www.meerageorge.com/), “Art is not an extra- curricular activity or a hobby class, often synonymous to a free period. Here, it is the means to bridge what learners absorb from the Sciences, Math, Environmental studies or History through a hands- on visual medium. When the concept of Time is explored in a science class, Salvador Dali’s melting clocks finds inspiration in the minds of our young learners, or when Shapes are discussed in Math, Henri Matisse’s whimsical paper collages lead the exploration in our Art class. Each of our thematic Art study is backed through a carefully planned process based learning to first Introduce, Explore, Develop and finally Present through self- reflection and peer critique. The result- an informed learner with honed skills and the ability to translate anything into Art. After all, Art is nothing but a reflection of the world we live in.” https://prakriti.edu.in/wp-content/uploads/Art-Design-PPt-in-Motion-_Jan-2022_SS.mp4\n\n\n\n--- Substack Article ---\nCan We Save the Planet or Should We Save Ourselves? Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts. Click here to read more about MannanA Campus Enriched by Nature's BountyOur landscape is a vibrant testament to our commitment to biodiversity and natural beauty. Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious",

    "main_content": "Self-directed Learning through Personal Projects by Prakriti | Dec 15, 2021 Self-directed Learning, a form of learning, where learners are in the driver seat of their own learning, has been seen to deliver great results for the educators, who around the world, are researching and deploying strategies that engage classrooms deeply. During self-directed learning, learners learn independently, setting their own goals and evaluating on their own during the course of learning. Experiential learning, a more commonly understood approach by the educators, refers to conscious events and perceptions, leading to practical knowledge and familiarity through observations. It focuses on an individual’s learning process and aims at development of skills – such as memory, creativity, and sensitivity – to achieve knowledge. There are various approaches to experiential learning, one of which is project based learning. Self-directed learning combined with experiential learning gives rise to Personal Projects as a learning tool. At Prakriti, learners get the opportunity to explore a topic of their individual liking by means of a personal project. Glimpses of their project presentations are captured here: https://prakriti.edu.in/personal-projects/ https://prakriti.edu.in/wp-content/uploads/Personal-Projects-_-The-Video1.mp4 The purpose is to build an ecosystem for independent thinking and learning. For some it could be furthering their known areas of interests, while for others it could be searching for and discovering what triggers them on. While the topic and execution is entirely driven by the learner, mentors facilitate this process of self-discovery. In a broader perspective, a personal project aims at developing meta-cognition skills, ie, awareness and understanding of one’s own thought processes. The learners should be able to reflect upon their ability to learn independently, manage time, overcome difficulties and collaborate with the mentor. Learners, Grades 4 onward have been involved in personal projects this year at Prakriti. Here, each learner chose a topic of his/her interest and developed into a project. Projects ranged from research reports, to practically building things, to conducting workshops. Children chose topics as diverse as studying how ships work, researching about the origins of Puranas (ancient scriptures), learning to do digital art, to building a firewood oven (and baking pizza in it). We are updating our website with video presentations of the learners’ projects: https://prakriti.edu.in/personal-projects/ The core idea of personal project based learning is to connect learners’ experiences with academics and to give then agency over learning concepts and skills that transfer to other domains of learning. Learners benefit from discoveries and experiments, while exploring personal and others’ real world experiences at the same time. Here, the teacher works like a sounding board and not a facilitator, mentoring the learner with thought-provoking questions and ideas. Learning focuses not just on cognitive progress, but also on social and emotional growth – which could be at least, if not more, important. This approach calls for a deeper understanding of the problem through ownership and concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract conceptualization and active experimentation , refer to David Kolb’s model to know more. In this blog, we’re discussing a few of the projects to understand how this approach brought the best out of these 8-13 year olds. In this first edition, we have provided glimpses into a few projects from our middle school. Experience the learner journeys on developing characters, a game, skilling as a barista and being a blogger with book reviews.\n\n\n\n--- Substack Article ---\nCan We Save the Planet or Should We Save Ourselves?

Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts. Click here to read more about MannanA Campus Enriched by Nature's BountyOur landscape is a vibrant testament to our commitment to biodiversity and natural beauty. Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious",

    "main_content": "EXPERIENCE FOR DEEP LEARNING Prakriti is a K-12 school with learner-centred curriculum and interdisciplinary learning methods. All learning at Prakriti is through experiences that build on the learner’s context. Inquiry and observations takes a learner out of the comfort zone to engage in deep learning. One child’s learning from an experience can be entirely different from another. We encourage diverse view-points and integrate those for building a wider perspective. Soft Robotics Bootcamp Personal Projects Nature Immersion OUTDOOR LEARNING Learning happens outside the classroom, in the lap of nature and with diverse community. Our classrooms emerge at monuments, archaeological sites, museums, design schools, art galleries and botanical gardens. When we are school, we prefer to sit under the trees and work. Ramgarh OLE GROW WITH NATURE As urban consumers, Prakriti children are made aware of the challenges of unsustainable farming. We learn the dependencies in our environment by growing our food. Learning directly from farmers makes the children aware of the science of farming. We also have the children and parents cook with farm-fresh produce to appreciate the taste of local grains and vegetables. EXPERIENCE THE FARM EMPOWER WITH INDIVIDUALISED LEARNING We have small class size of at most 20 children per class. Our teachers, work with children on one-to-one basis and develop their plans keeping each child’s learning styles in mind. We develop individual learning plans to provide mentoring and resources to hone the interests and instincts each child possesses View More CONNECT WITH LEARNING SPACES Both our campuses have been designed to inspire creativity and concentration. Our spaces are open, green and inclusive designed in an interesting geometry to inspire children to study. We have no doors classrooms to make it all a boundary-less and free space that inspires inner discipline to be responsible. Visit School Campus DEVELOP INNER DISCIPLINE A reflective environment for self-awareness and inner discipline are key elements of our classrooms. Our children start their day with mindfulness exercises, have daily circle time for sharing personal experiences and ‘bubble time’ for resolving conflicts. Each class creates a constitution for itself and revisits rights, responsibilities and consequences from time to time. Circle Time LEARN FROM DIVERSITY We actively support a cultural and talent exchange with children from poor economic backgrounds. Children learn from them on their “life-hacks” and gifts of talent and in exchange we share our knowledge and experiences. That’s why we support the year-round residency of children from Janwaar castle, each one of whom is an award-winning skateboarder and take our children to volunteer at SETU School (Noida) and Kechala School (Orissa) Kechala School Immersion Celebrating Festivals as Virtues At Prakriti, key festivals or seasons are celebrated as celebration of virtues in ourselves: we celebrate Loving-Kindness in August, Truth & Courage in October, Generosity in December and Sustainability & Gratitude (Mannan) in February. Our parent community participates whole-heartedly in the festivals with pot-luck, theatre, dances and making green products. Truth & Courage 2022 Generosity 2021 Seva Day 2022 Mannan 2022 TURNING PASSION INTO PROJECTS The consistent practice at Prakrit is to have learners explore their interests further by undertaking projects that allow them to go deeper. These projects are mentored by the facilitators just to set the direction and curate resources if needed but the learners are on the driving seat. They need to present their work which is not a research finding but a product that is original, born out of their exploration. Personal Projects SPORTS FOR EVERY LEARNER At Prakriti everyone goes through sports training every day in the morning. We firmly believe that play is vital to growth as it develops strength of the mind, stamina and flexibility. We introduce learners to at least three (3) sports in a year. By the time they are in Grade 8, they make a choice to specialise and compete in any one sport. Every learner must demonstrate their learning on the Sports Day which is non-competitive.

Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness.

This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts. Click here to read more about MannanA Campus Enriched by Nature's BountyOur landscape is a vibrant testament to our commitment to biodiversity and natural beauty. Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious",

    "description": "",
    "main_content": "Teaching-Learning through Projects with Grade 4 Last Year by Yamini Pal | Jul 18, 2020 Prakriti uses project-based learning approach extensively to go beyond the restricted and often incomplete academic understanding to deeper appreciation of concepts. Each project combines the children’s expressions of creativity – verbal as well as written, music as well as dance, art as well as craft, with experiments to observe real-life concepts concretely, collection of factual information, while developing a spirit of curiosity, inquisitiveness, reasoning, logical thinking, and deduction. All projects have elements of hands-on work either related to art, environment or science, to facilitate the development of integrated knowledge of the same. Last year, I worked on about four projects, on an average of six weeks’ duration each with Grade Four. Here I discuss how I went through teaching-learning process on these projects: Me, Myself and My Family: Awareness of self in relation to the social environment, helps an individual to better understand and reflect upon the world around him/her. The project Me and Myself was aimed at developing awareness of one’s emotional triggers, likes and dislikes, a sense of independence and responsibility towards family. From making personalized emotional graphs to exploring gender stereotypes, the project proceeded in a gradual progression from ‘Me’ to ‘Myself’ to ‘My family’. The project created an opportunity for children to form a deeper understanding of each other’s families. Children wrote about what makes a family a “family”, which directed them towards challenging their preconceived notions about a family. They studied varied family compositions, for instance, a single parent family, joint family, a nuclear family and adoptive families. Such activities helped children to build empathy, appreciate and respect cultural and ethnic diversity, and reflect on the fact that each family has to work together to run a household and build a conducive family environment, and is unique and happy! This thought was reinforced through simulation of day to day household activities. Birds: The group embarked on a mission to gather all the knowhow needed to make the transformation from birdwatchers to avid bird admirers! Not only did they get the opportunity to observe the birds in their natural habitat by visiting places like Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary, but they also created opportunities for observation themselves by making bird baths at home. They further explored “What makes a bird a bird?” and identified its various characteristics. From scientifically enquiring how a sound is produced to comparing birds’ beaks with simple machines, the learners went deeper into the process of learning. Throughout the project, they were able to document their detailed observations in the observation sheets, commenting on the types of feet, beaks, tail and feathers. Diversity in Flora: To strengthen the connect with nature, the project Diversity in Flora was initiated. The project started with identification of the unique characteristics of different plants. They categorised the different parts of plants as edible and non- edible. Children were able to break their preconception that every underground part of a plant is a root, when they observed structural differences between bulbs and roots. Children were introduced to characteristic features such as simple and compound leaves, tap and fibrous roots. Through experiments, they could learn how plants take essential elements from the environment, make predictions and corroborate them. Children’s curiosity about what plants do with water and air, probed them to unravel the process of photosynthesis through videos and discussions. My Neighborhood, My City: The project aimed at creating an understanding of neighbourhood and becoming an active participant in identifying the needs of the community. Children explored and observed the components in their surroundings and classified them into categories like houses, facilities, cleanliness, parking and others. Children also explored the use of landmarks and various signage. They mapped their neighbourhood strengthening their mapping skills. They have learned to decipher the components of an address and analysed the meaning and progression of writing an address. Children were asked to identify the pictures of iconic parts of the city, for instance metro, Chandni chowk market, Mall of India etc. In addition to the activity, a famous monument of the city, Qutub Minar was discussed in detail. Children wrote the ‘Tale of Qutub Minar’ personifying themselves as Qutub Minar and expressed the changes that have happened around the monument and in the city over time.

She loves to experiment new tools and build on meta-cognitive skills (how to think) in her learners.\n\n\n\n--- Substack Article ---\nCan We Save the Planet or Should We Save Ourselves? Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school.

Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts. Click here to read more about MannanA Campus Enriched by Nature's BountyOur landscape is a vibrant testament to our commitment to biodiversity and natural beauty. Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious",

Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts. Click here to read more about MannanA Campus Enriched by Nature's BountyOur landscape is a vibrant testament to our commitment to biodiversity and natural beauty. Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious",

    "main_content": "Celebrating Truth and Courage at Prakriti by Prakriti | Nov 26, 2020 Truth and Courage Celebration at Prakriti around Diwali is the celebration of virtues that make us a better human being. In the Truth and Courage celebration, learners are guided to perform their acts of courage on an aspect that’s untried before as a group and create a symphony with their peers. Here are few glimpses from our celebration. Red Group (Pre-Nursery) 'Ganesh Vandana' Starting with Red Group, our youngest learners who are three (3) years old, performed ‘Ganesh Vanadana’. In the Truth and Courage celebration, learners are guided to perform their acts of courage on an aspect that’s untried before as a group and create a symphony with their peers. Sunrise Group (Grade 6) 'Mahishasur Mardini Strotam' Devotional stotra of Goddess Durga ‘Mahisasur Mardini’ written by Guru Adi Sankaracharya was recited and sang by learners of Sunrise Group together. Luminosity Group (Grade 6) 'Kathputli Ka Raja' दीपावली के विशेष अवसर पर ‘ ट्रुथ एंड करेज प्रोग्राम ‘ के तहत कक्षा छ: लुमिनोसिटी ग्रुप के छात्रों ने ‘ कठपुतली का राजा ‘ नामक नाटक की प्रस्तुति तैयार की जिसकी मूलसंवेदना है कठिन समय में बैर-भाव को दूर करते हुए मदद करना। इसे कठपुतलियों के अभिनय के द्वारा, कविता और संवादों के माध्यम से दर्शाया गया है। नाटक में दो राजाओं के बीच जंग होने वाली है। दोनों राजाओं को जंग पर जाना है। एक राजा योध्दाओं वाले कपड़े पहने हुए , अपनी तलवार, ढाल और भाला लेकर मैदान में आता है तथा दूसरा राजा जो हर अवसर पर सज-संवरकर के रहना पसंद करता है, भले ही जंग लड़ने क्यों न जाने हो ? और जंग लड़ने के लिए तलवार और ढाल की जगह शीशा ले जाता है तो क्या होता होगा ? दुश्मन राजा से कैसे सामना करता होगा ? जब कोई संकट आता होगा तो उसका उपाय कैसे निकालता होगा ? इन्हीं सब घटनाओं को लुमिनोसिटी ग्रुप के छात्रों ने बड़े ही रोचक तरीके से दिखाया है। Unity Group (Grade 7) 'Inter-Being' by Thich Nhat Hanh “Emptiness does not mean nothingness. Saying that we are empty does not mean that we do not exist. No matter if something is full or empty, that thing clearly needs to be there in the first place. When we say a cup is empty, the cup must be there in order to be empty. When we say that we are empty, it means that we must be there in order to be empty of a permanent, separate self. About thirty years ago I was looking for an English word to describe our deep interconnection with everything else. I liked the word “togetherness,” but I finally came up with the word “interbeing.” The verb “to be” can be misleading, because we cannot be by ourselves, alone. “To be” is always to “inter-be.” If we combine the prefix “inter” with the verb “to be,” we have a new verb, “inter-be.” To inter-be and the action of interbeing reflects reality more accurately. We inter-are with one another and with all life.” Thich Nhat Hanh Integrity Group (Grade 3) 'Anandaloke Mangalaloke' Anandaloke Mangaloke, a song composed by Rabindranath Tagore for expressing devotion to the divine. An English translation of the song is as follows: In this world of bliss, as the light of blessing, Thou dost reign, O Glory and Truth. Thy majestic splendour Sets alight the firmament, All the sparkling jewel worlds Lie circled at Thy feet. Planets, stars, moon and sun, Yearning, spinning swiftly, Imbibe thy radiance, Immersed in Thy eternal rays. Honeyed showers of ceaseless beauty Charm and bless the Earth In flower and leaf, in symphony, Aroma, glowing colour. Day and night the stream of life Surges ever fresh Through life and death, incessant flows Thy benevolent grace. Caring, kindness, love, devotion, Mellow and soothe the soul. What bounteous solace Thou dost pour To wash away all pain. With pomp and celebration The universe adores Thee. Wondrous bounty! O Almighty! Fearless Sanctuary! Honesty Group (Grade 5) 'Dastangoi' कहानी कहने के तमाम तरह की विधाएं विकसित हुई हैं, उन्हीं में से ‘ दास्तानगोई ‘ 13 वीं शताब्दी की उर्दू मौखिक कहानी कला का कलात्मक रूप है जिसमें मंच के केंद्र में कहानी कहने वाला कलाकार होता है जिसे ‘ दास्तानगो ‘ कहा जाता है। दास्तानगो एक ही जगह बैठे हुए अपने चेहरे की भाव-भंगगिमाओं और आवाज़ के जादू से कहानी कहता है। कक्षा पाँच के होनेस्टी ग्रुप ने ‘ दास्तानगोई ‘ विधा के ज़रिए कहानी ‘ अबू खां की बकरी ‘ को प्रस्तुत किया है जिसमें बताया गया कि जब हमारे सामने कोई बड़ा संकट आ जाता है तो हिम्मत और समझदारी से किस तरह से काम लेना चाहिए ? संकट चाहे जितना बड़ा हो, इंसान के साहस से बड़ा नहीं होता है। धैर्य और समझदारी से सोचने पर सारे रास्ते नज़र आने लगते हैं। यह कहानी एक ऐसी ही बकरी चांदनी की है जिसे पहाड़ों की खुली हवा पसंद है, खेलना-कूदना उसे भाता है और इसी चक्कर में एक दिन मुसीबत में पड़ जाती है क्योंकि उसके सामने भेड़िया आ जाता है तो ऐसे में क्या चांदनी यह मान ले कि उसके पास बचकर निकलने का कोई तरीका नहीं है ? या अपनी समझ बूझ से चांदनी अपने आप को बचा ले जाए ? तो आइए सुनते हैं कक्षा पाँच के होनेस्टी ग्रुप द्वारा तैयार की गई ‘ दास्तानगोई ‘ :-\n\n\n\n--- Substack Article ---\nCan We Save the Planet or Should We Save Ourselves?

    "main_content": "Filmoscope: Prakriti Film Making Workshop’21 by Prakriti | Jul 2, 2021 This summer we conducted a Film-making workshop Filmoscope where 12 learners from Prakriti and outside participated with Boishali Sinha, Prakriti Film Studies Mentor. The four basic steps of making a movie were introduced to the children one after the other: concept, scripting, shooting, and editing. First, The children understood the purpose of film making with visual demonstration. Gradually they developed a concept in a proper screenplay format. What is their movie about? Is it a fictional story or a true one? Is it a comedy or a drama? Will you need actors? What story are you trying to tell? These questions and more were answered while developing the concept for the movie. Then, they created a script with a beginning, a middle, and an end. Also, part of the scripting process is storyboarding. Storyboarding is where you lay out in a sequence of pictures what the audience will see and hear in the movie. Then, you shoot your movie. Following the storyboard, you get the shots you need. So the understanding of shots and camera angle, the prominence of shots, equipment used and required in film making were introduced to the children then comes the editing. Editing is where they put all of the pieces together to produce the final product. Different softwares and their respective use cases were taught. After all of the steps have been completed, their movie was ready to be shown to friends and family and even a public audience. As Spielberg said “EVERY TIME I GO TO A MOVIE, IT’S MAGIC, NO MATTER WHAT THE MOVIE’S ABOUT.” So all their work was magic.

Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community.

The purpose of the residency was to enable deep social learning in nature after a hiatus of almost 1.5 years of the school lockdown and to experience simple living in a commune. The residency was attended by 75 learners and 18 parents. Followed by the long, challenging treks everyday, the immersive programmes that the learners engaged in were as follows: Understanding Himalayan vegetation and biomes, the birds and the reptiles around the Ashram Learning about local culture, people, beliefs and businesses Nature-based mixed media art and local art styles (Aippan) Improvised theatre Book appreciation The glimpses of the programmes are as under. A few reflections from the learners are also shared as under: “I felt really homesick initially but the engrossing work” “I didn’t like the simple living at the ashram initially, the hard beds and lack of ‘pleasure’ food but it became part of my routine and I didn’t seem to mind it” “I was petrified of heights and trekking on narrow trails but came away with the feeling of conquering my fear” “I loved the freedom within the schedule, of choosing our projects, roles, treks and of spending time over games and music”\n\n\n\n--- Substack Article ---\nCan We Save the Planet or Should We Save Ourselves?

    "main_content": "Homes : Multidisciplinary Project based learning Grade 2 by Prakriti | Jan 14, 2022 In the current times of easy accessibility to a one-stop platform for any information like Google, it is significantly important to calibrate the surge of exposure in the learning journeys of our young learners. They must be encouraged to inertly foster a higher degree of collaborative task management, exercise their understanding through observational learning while balancing and navigating through excessive information download. In our endeavor to motivated young learners and forge in quest to inquire, systematically research, and learn to assimilate their learnings, our end-of-the-season theme “Homes” made an interesting point. The theme invariably imbued an overwhelming response from amongst our Grade 2 group children who explored varieties of home styles, structured models from an assortment of materials for creating homes, explored animal habitats, and constructively explored Google Earth to find houses in different parts of the world. Interpretation of the word – HOME Learners were encouraged to interpret the meaning of home/house as per their understanding and comfortably share their favorite spots/ moments/ conversations they could recall. This exercise helped them collectively to take short trips into the lives of their cohort and discover more about each other on a personal level, something that had been a miss owing to the pandemic. Unusual Homes The continued conversations led to the discussions over the ownership of one’s space, e.g: Who maintains it, how they contribute to it in their everyday lives, and the same in the larger context of community living. Facilitators divulged in expanding their understanding of home structures in geographical and historical contexts at this point too.For example : Cycladic houses take their name from the Cyclades, a group of islands in Greece’s Aegean Sea. The pure white exterior — traditionally achieved with a lime whitewash — creates the distinctive look and helps reflect the hot summer sun. Plus, the lime acts as a natural disinfectant.Source : Google Similarly ,a unit from Cambridge titled ‘Tales from around the World’ was introduced at this juncture, wherein learners were engaged in identifying the physical features and habitats of different animals/birds that may have had influenced their eventual habitat design. Describing words was introduced through an assortment of images to persuade them to create prose/ riddles from the learning and present them elective.For example the “The House of Hair – Jordan”, may sound strange however this very unique form of housing – the Bait Al Shaar, or house of hair is created by the Bedouins and is a labor of love by Bedouins women, who are single-handedly responsible for producing the tent onsite, starting with making thread out of sheep/goat hair and then weaving the thread into fabric before finally sewing the sheets of fabric into a tent.Source: Gulf News My Future House: A project A project -based engagement to propel learners imagination and forge into creativity. As the name suggests, learners were encouraged to think organically; and place themselves in conditions less experienced.From it they were directed to either creatively write or draw the personal aspirations for their “Dream Homes”. Here are a few snippets. The final presentation was ,by each learner wherein he /she presented a homes style from a specific region and its salient features which make it extremely unique and ideal for the stated locations.Exploration with Google Earth saw learners educating themselves and their batch mates of various types of homes from around the world and diving deeper into the architectural features. Mongolian Ger Hanok House Reed House Fujian Tulou Bird House The fear of over load of information specially amongst the younger generation is real however if this very technology is mindfully utilized it will continue to play a vital role in building the future by creating opportunities for widespread communication and collaborative outcomes.\n\n\n\n--- Substack Article ---\nCan We Save the Planet or Should We Save Ourselves? Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts. Click here to read more about MannanA Campus Enriched by Nature's BountyOur landscape is a vibrant testament to our commitment to biodiversity and natural beauty. Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious",

    "title": "INCLUSIVE EDUCATION: REPURPOSING SPECIAL NEEDS LEARNING TO CELEBRATING NEURODIVERSITY - Prakriti",
    "description": "",
    "main_content": "INCLUSIVE EDUCATION: REPURPOSING SPECIAL NEEDS LEARNING TO CELEBRATING NEURODIVERSITY by Prakriti | Aug 13, 2021 Every child has the right to quality education and learning (UNICEF) Aristotle, a Greek philosopher said, “Things that are alike should be treated alike, whereas things that are unalike should be treated unalike in proportion to their un-alikeness”. Under the concept of ‘neurodiversity’, disability is a universal feature of human diversity. The variations are normal and the kids with these differences are equally mainstream as their peers. However, celebrating differences is not enough to help kids with learning differences for educating at schools. Without an ‘identified disability’ label, they can not be protected under special education laws. Apart from this, other advantages include realizing challenges which require additional support and preventing these kids from being overlooked and falling through the cracks, recognizing their strengths and learning style, etc. Therefore, both “acceptance and respect for difference” are crucial for humanity to move forward. ISCED, UNESCO (36th Session, Paris 2011) states Special Needs Education as “Education designed to facilitate the learning of individuals who, for a wide variety of reasons, require additional support and adaptive pedagogical methods in order to participate and meet learning objectives in an educational programme. Reasons may include (but are not limited to) disadvantages in physical, behavioural, intellectual, emotional and social capacities”. However, the version of Special Educational Needs (SEN) differs with different countries. To some, it is limited to traditional disabilities. Others such as countries under OECD have recognized three cross-national categories: DDD – Disabilities (organic disorders attributable to motor, sensory, or neurological defects), Difficulties (learning difficulties because of behavioural or emotional disorders), and Disadvantages (attributed to socio-economic, cultural, and/or linguistic factors). Whatever be the categories, the world is moving on from an era where disabled learners were separated from the mainstream and taught in specialized institutions with an entirely different curriculum. Today, the educational programmes for special needs education are becoming similar in curriculum with already existing regular education – advancing towards the path of inclusion. Towards an Ideal System: Inclusive Education The Inclusive Model of Special Education aims at welcoming and supporting all children to learn together, irrespective of their abilities or requirements. This includes appropriation of pedagogical approach, curriculum, therapies provided, school building and classrooms, playground, toilets and transportation at all levels for all children. The model extends to special educational needs in teaching students with disability and their peers with no disability under the same roof in the least restrictive environment. The special needs and regular educators must work together to maximise the potential of all the students. Additional support in the form of resources (such as personal [IEPs, extra time], material [scribe, reader, using calculator, etc.] or financial resources), specially trained personnel and specialists (such as speech and physical therapists, intensive literacy coaches, etc.) are provided, either in the classroom itself or outside, depending upon the individual’s needs. More than 60 percent of students with disabilities in the US spend 80 percent of their day in regular classrooms (US National Center for Education Statistics). “Inclusive education is not an optional extra, it is a basic necessity. We must put the most vulnerable at the heart of our actions to achieve a better life for all.” – Androulla Vassiliou, European Commissioner for Education According to an evaluation of 280+ studies conducted in 25 countries by Abt Associates, an inclusive education system promoted stronger math and reading skills, higher attendance, and graduation rates. The success of IE is credited in achieving the following cases: – Educational Case: Improvement in learning for all students (with or without disabilities) by promoting individuality and equity through personalized and thoughtful instructions. – Social Case: Promotion of social integration, understanding and respect for fellow learners and development of positive relationships with diverse peer groups. – Economic Case: Contribution to the society (economically, socially, and politically) by equipping children with disabilities to work. Adopting Inclusive Education in India Legality As rightly said, “Inclusion is not tolerance, it is unquestioned acceptance”, the right to inclusive education for all persons with disabilities is recognized by the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). In India, the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPWD Act) provides statutory backing to inclusive education. The Act covers the following specified disabilities – physical disability (locomotor disability, visual impairment, hearing impairment, speech and language disability), intellectual disability (Specific Learning Disabilities, Autism Spectrum Disorder), mental behaviour, chronic neurological conditions (Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease), blood disorders (Haemophilia, Thalassemia, Sickle Cell Disease), and other disabilities. To learn more about the Act, visit: http://disabilityaffairs.gov.in/content/page/acts.php Success However, in India, 89% of the kids with learning disabilities are enrolled in primary schools but only 8.5% go to secondary schools and only 2.3% reach higher secondary (Census of India). This is because of a lack of clarity on ‘inclusion’ for quality of education. Several inconsistencies exist in on-ground implementation of the laws. The RTE Act indirectly advances the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995 (PWD Act, 1995) which focuses on ‘fitting disabled students into mainstream’ rather than ‘system adapting to their needs’. Problems Some of the major problems in implementation of IE in India include no standard methodology for the identification of children with disabilities, limited choice for parents of children with disabilities, overworked teachers and special educators, and inaccessible infrastructure and curriculum (Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy). The New Education Policy (NEP) has brought hope to the people for the educational revolution. With the recognition of RPWD Act, 2016, the NEP has recommended non-discriminatory environment in schools, use of Braille and Indian Sign Language for teaching, accessible infrastructure, and individualized support among others. However, for the education of children with special needs, it does not answer all the problems existing within a framework of grave policy gaps. In India, less than 40% of the schools have ramps. Access to basic amenities such as toilets are provided by around 17% of schools only. NEP has a great focus on use of technology in schools but only 59% of them have access to electricity. The special schools for children with benchmark disabilities are included but not recognized as schools. This leads us towards social isolation, and not inclusion. Introduction of ‘school complexes’ (schools within a 5-10-kilometer radius will be consolidated within one school complex) solves the problem of shortage of special educators and resources but aggravates the problems of safety concerns associated with transportation and travelling expenses. Another major concern surrounds the idea of viewing special education as a specialization for regular teachers. Several studies have documented that teachers in India do not have enough support in the form of adequate training, infrastructure, and others for inclusive education. Hiring in contract positions, lower pay grade, and hostile working conditions for special educators makes the situation worse. Further, NEP empowers PARAKH (National Assessment Centre) to provide accessible assessment guidelines to children with learning disabilities, thus marginalizing children with intellectual and cognitive disabilities. They do not find a place in NEP. Terminological inconsistency blatantly exists which has real-world implications. NEP is full of synonymous use of words – inclusion, integration, mitigation and rehabilitation, and disability, differently-abled, children with special needs and others. The error in word choice has several consequences on policies, societal recognition and stigmas, and adoption of inclusion as the way forward and not merely being a charitable cause. Inclusion Strategies to make it happen in India “In special education, there’s too much emphasis placed on deficit and not enough on strength.” – Temple Grandia Establishment of a successful inclusive learning environment is a complex process involving transformation of the whole education system. It requires coordinated efforts of administrators, schools and teachers, and families, altogether. Some inclusion strategies to make it successful are as follows: ACCESSIBLE SCHOOLS: The school must adopt the best practices and should be based on internationally accepted accessibility standards. They must accommodate the mobility, sensory, and other needs of disabled children. TEACHING AND SUPPORT STAFF: The pre- and in-service training pertaining to disability and inclusive education should be mandatory for all the staff members. The classrooms must have both the teachers – special education and regular working in harmony. Educators with disabilities must be hired to provide their unique insights and serve as role models. CURRICULUM DESIGN: Although provided with the provision of modification and adaptation, following the same curriculum by the disabled as their non-disabled peers is strongly recommended. A variety of techniques and resources can be utilized beforehand to keep the same pace. These include graphic organizers, visual, manipulative, text, and questioning techniques. Adoption of an adaptable learning environment and UDL: Universal Design for Learning (UDL) aims at using a variety of teaching methods to build flexibility (i.e., adjusted for an individual’s strength and weakness) and remove barriers (for example, neurological disorders) to learning. Adopting UDL is an example of an adaptable learning environment and is essential for building awareness around differentiated learning. Assessments and IEPs: Conducting regular assessments helps in determination of achievement of academic goals by the students. The educational objectives and expectations can be lowered or raised as per the requirement to sufficiently challenge without overwhelming children by organizing periodic IEP (Individualized Education Plan) meetings with students, their families and concerned teachers. SUPPORT OF GOVERNMENT: The Ministry of Education must refrain from dividing responsibilities of supporting disabled students among ministries because this segregation will aggravate the problem of shifting focus from catering to educational needs and inclusion approach to isolation. It must be responsible for the education of all the children going to school, irrespective of disability diagnosis and its severity. Reallocation of budget: The budget for segregated schools must be redirected towards inclusive schools. The budget should be transparent and publicly available. The previously existing segregated and integrated schools must be transitioned into resource centres to provide guidance and technical support based on their past experiences and area of expertise. ADVOCATING FOR STUDENTS AND UPROOTING STIGMAS: It is essential to ensure the awareness among the school staff (administrators and regular educators), parents, and community members about the success and importance of an inclusive approach. The associated concerns must be proactively raised and discussed. The inclusion-focused developmental activities and practices should be encouraged. Parents must be actively involved to be a part of a student’s experience in school to facilitate learning. The disabled students must not be solely focused in the class to reduce unintended stigma. RECOGNITION OF COMPLETE SPECTRUM OF DISABILITY: The recognition of neurological disorders and others along with traditional disorders is important to unfold the complete spectrum of disability. Under Cambridge Assessment International Education (CAIE), the learners with special educational needs are recognized by the following (including combinations): Behavioural and social skill difficulties: Includes self-regulation, getting along with others, etc. Communication or language disabilities: Either receptive or expressive (e.g., autism spectrum). Concentration difficulties: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or attention deficit disorder (ADD) and other neurological disorders. Executive functions: Difficulties in understanding, planning and organizing. Hearing impairments: Hearing loss and deafness, either congenital or acquired. Literacy and language difficulties: Includes problems in reading, spelling and writing (for example, dyslexia and dysgraphia). Numeracy difficulties: Struggle with tasks related to numeracy and mathematics competency (for example, dyscalculia). Mental health issues: Includes depression, anxiety, etc. Physical or neurological impairments Can be congenital or acquired (for example, muscular dystrophy or traumatic brain injury). Visual impairments: Eye condition or disorder. Inclusive Education at Prakriti At Prakriti, the ‘Bridge Programme’ focuses on inclusive education for the children with special needs. BRIDGE@PRAKRITI assists children to close the gaps in their learning and to integrate them into the mainstream by offering one-to-one sessions within a school setup. A skilled team of ABA (Applied Behaviour Analysis), Speech, Vocational and Occupational Therapists as well as Special Educators make it a customized support system.

Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts. Click here to read more about MannanA Campus Enriched by Nature's BountyOur landscape is a vibrant testament to our commitment to biodiversity and natural beauty. Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious",

    "main_content": "Prakriti Learners Winners of ITIHAAS Anveshan 2020 by Prakriti | Nov 3, 2020 The team of young Prakriti learners competed with 100 school teams in the finals at the music competition “ITIHAAS ANVESHAN ONLINE“, with their original composition. We are extremely proud to announce that Prakriti learners have been declared as winners in the category “School voices: Act of Kindnes”. We appreciate the collaborative spirit of the learners, who composed the song, designed the props, costumes and edited the videos all by themselves under stupendous mentoring from their music facilitators. The finals was held on 31st October 2020. Here is the award announcement from ITIHAAS Anveshan\n\n\n\n--- Substack Article ---\nCan We Save the Planet or Should We Save Ourselves? Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts. Click here to read more about MannanA Campus Enriched by Nature's BountyOur landscape is a vibrant testament to our commitment to biodiversity and natural beauty. Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious",

    "main_content": "Ten Years of a Collective Aspiration by Prakriti | May 11, 2021 This week the spirit of freedom in expression and creation was visible across all the classrooms at Prakriti. While the younger learners chose to celebrate the day with what they enjoyed the most with activities ranging from making the inkblot (Prakriti’s logo), listening to stories of its origin to potting their plants. The older learners (Grade 4 onwards) interacted with their “seniors” and parents to understand their journeys at Prakriti. Inkblots Here’s how the youngest group (Blue Group/Nursery) celebrated making works of fine art by making the inkblot they observe everyday. Our Green Group (KG) made birthday cards. a cake, and made their inkblots as well. All expanding and permeating deeper at the core. Personal Dialogues #1: Learners from Grade 4-6 interacted with their “seniors” in Grades 7-9 to understand what they cherished, their joys and intrigues at school and what they would like to change. We present a couple of snippets here. (We regret that we had to shorten the videos of these highly interesting conversations). To watch the complete dialogues, please write to us at xway@prakriti.org.in Individual Offering & Planting: Our junior primary grades sketched the parts of the school they loved the most and potted their plants at home with aspirations for the school. Personal Dialogues #2: Our parents pitched in to reminisce the beginnings and share their joys at the school with the young learners as they posed their questions. It was heartwarming to see many parents join in, old and new, during this time especially. To watch the complete dialogues, please write to us at xway@prakriti.org.in\n\n\n\n--- Substack Article ---\nCan We Save the Planet or Should We Save Ourselves?

Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts. Click here to read more about MannanA Campus Enriched by Nature's BountyOur landscape is a vibrant testament to our commitment to biodiversity and natural beauty. Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious",

    "main_content": "Understanding National and International Boards (Cambridge & IB) by Prakriti | Feb 16, 2022 Contents Decoding the Boards: Cambridge (IGCSE), IB and the Indian BoardsThe Tyranny of Choice: Difference between Various Boards (IGCSE, IB, CBSE, ICSE)Growing prominence of Cambridge and IBAre International boards better than CBSE?Cambridge IGCSE vs IBWhat to look for when choosing an international school? An education board is responsible for implementing the educational policy in a city, state, or country. Given that education is a state subject but has repercussions on acceptance at centrally funded higher education universities or central government jobs, India has a mix of national (like CBSE and ICSE) as well as state boards. India has also allowed the international boards to coexist with the national boards in the spirit of democracy and globalisation. Examples of international boards include International Baccalaureate (IB), Cambridge Assessment International Education (Cambridge International/CAIE), etc. It is no wonder that the parents are perplexed about the plethora of these certifying bodies, while making a choice for their children The boards differ in their ideology of ‘education’ and approach towards attainment of ‘learning’. The curriculum, acceptance level around the world, ease of transfer, grading system, instructional medium and many other aspects such as competitive edge show quite variability. These factors form the base to choose an ideal board catering to one’s needs. The Tyranny of Choice: Difference between Various Boards (IGCSE, IB, CBSE, ICSE) With multiple boards such as CBSE, IB, IGCSE and others, the vast majority of the parents are bemused with the choice offered by different education boards as each board vehemently broadcasts their best features. For selection of an ideal education board, a crucial step towards the development of the child’s education, the parents must be well-informed and follow a universal rubric to weigh the pros and cons of each system. Let’s understand how these boards came about to being: In 1965, the existing Board of Rajputana at Ajmer, which was dominant in five states, was reformed as the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). Funnily, within a few years, private schools were allowed to become connected with the CBSE because it gained popularity and Kendriya Vidyalayas’ found it difficult to expand anymore. Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE), a Christian Minority board, passed down from the British, is comparable to the CBSE in terms of syllabus standards. The board is well-known both nationally and globally, and it employs application-based teaching methods. Students are evaluated on the basis of marks and percentages, and the board provides good training for global competitive tests. The State board uses a syllabus specified by the education department, and is relatively simple and easy for the students to follow. The state board lacks international recognition, and the training provided for global boards is fairly basic. Transitioning from State board to other boards can be difficult for some students who have grown up learning on one. Some make the leap for lack of subject options while others move to a different city or state. International Baccalaureate (IB) is a nonprofit organization offering the following four educational programmes: IB Primary Years Programme (PYP) (aged 3-12), IB Middle years Programme (MYP) (aged 11-16), and IB Diploma Programme and IB Career-related Programme (aged 15-19). Cambridge Assessment International Education(CAIE)/International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) and Cambridge International AS & A Level follows the Cambridge International Examinations curriculum, where students earn credit points for the subjects they choose and only advance to the next level once they have earned the required number of credits. Growing prominence of Cambridge and IB While the number of IB schools grew from mere 45 in 2007 to 215+ by 2017, the Cambridge board saw a rise from 100 to around 430 as of 2018. It almost seems like 40-50 schools were added year on year. In India, nearly a third of IB and a large number of Cambridge schools are in Maharashtra. The southern states of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu also feature in the top five states with Cambridge and IB system-based schools. According to ISC Research studies, in the last 7 years, the number of international school students has grown by 45%. The reason behind these boards gaining such popularity and momentum lies in the culture and attitude toward education, and implementation across each country. These two boards are application-based, inculcate research skills, develop communication skills and foster better collaboration among children by working on projects, and shifting the mindset from acquiring knowledge to mastering the skill of acquiring it. Leading institutions in India, under the International Day School category, include Dhirubhai Ambani International School (DAIS), Mumbai followed by Aditya Birla World Academy, Mumbai and Oberoi International School, Mumbai and Ecole Mondiale World School, Mumbai jointly. According to the ‘Education World’ (EW) study, Prakriti School ranked 2nd in Noida and 7th in NCR under the International Day School category. Leading Cambridge (IGCSE) Schools in NCR region are: Prakriti School, Noida Scottish High, Gurugram DPS International, Delhi Ardee School (Delhi) Indus World School, Gurugram GD Goenka Global School, Gurugram Step by Step School, Noida Are International boards better than CBSE? The major concern around CBSE and ICSE is that both the boards are highly examination-focused. Teachers in the CBSE and ICSE schools teach to test. The schools focus excessively on the prescribed curriculum and de-prioritise creativity and real-life learning. Furthermore, the exposure to higher order thinking and communication skills especially in English as First Language is limited as most of the curriculum is tilted towards developing a good level of skills in Math and Science. Especially, in CBSE, there is no option for learners inclined towards arts or vocational subjects to not take the Sciences. National Education Policy 2020 recognized these rigidities and examination-centredness in CBSE and so it recommended splitting the examination over two years, making curriculum experiential and making the course streams liberal to offer a blend of Sciences and Arts. Boards such as Cambridge and IB provide an array of choices to the students. At the upper secondary (Grade 9-10) level both IGCSE and IB MYP provide a range of subjects such as Art & Design, Drama, Global Perspectives, Design and Technology and World Literature. At Grade 12 or IBDP and Cambridge A levels the selection of subjects is wider although IBDP (Grade 12) tends to be more rigid than CBSE or IGCSE, with its structure of 6 baskets and Theory of Knowledge and Extended Essay. The other advantages of these boards include: (a) Higher Education Prospects International boards such as IGCSE or IB provide the launchpad to pursue higher education outside India. Higher education prospects open up due to flexibility in subjects that help a student experience a wider choice and apply to universities with a broader array of options such as liberal arts, design, and specialist sciences. University Grants Commission, through its division Association of International Universities (AIU), recognizes international boards paving the way to all national universities, including the centralised entrance examination such as IIT and NEET. Prakriti recently conducted a webinar that discussed the higher education prospects, both in India and abroad, after Cambridge A Levels and IBDP. Watch the recording: (b) Futurist Pedagogy International boards are learner-centered. These systems encourage research, creativity and give equal importance to activity-based learning as to learning of abstract concepts. International boards are far more aligned to technology-based and project-based learning. The technological courses offered such as Design and Technology in IGCSE and Product & Digital Design in IB are about developing solutions such as an application or a robotic function. (c) Focus on Skills vs Knowledge International boards aim at turning students into global citizens by exposing them to a diverse array of backgrounds and cultures. The programmes such as ‘Global Perspective’ under Cambridge lower secondary course inculcates critical thinking about topics with a global perspective. While the languages courses build an appreciation of world literature, the other subjects emphasize on examining and analysing issues and validating ideas with research. (d) Small class size and personalized approach A higher level of personalized attention is required at all stages of development of school students, especially in the world full of distraction and competing priorities. International curriculum provides small class sizes which provide the opportunity of learning at one’s pace and the set of strengths of the individual student. Cambridge IGCSE vs IB The Cambridge system is among the finest, preparing school students for life by fostering informed curiosity and a lifelong love of studying. Cambridge qualifications are internationally recognised, have a strong reputation and will hold its value throughout a person’s educational and professional career. There are clear merits of Cambridge over IB, especially with respect to subject flexibility, economics and popularity in India. The former enjoys a structured curriculum which alleviates the pressure over teachers in designing the curriculum over the latter. IB requires one to take Sciences and Math whereas IGCSE awards can happen without either. IB schools are more expensive because of the multiple workshops offered and the requirement of greater resources to develop the programme efficiently. IGCSE precedes IB in India as availability of teachers for IB is strenuous due to the requirement of curriculum design. What to look for when choosing an international school? Innovative adaptations in curriculum, outstanding teachers, cultural exposure, and supporting infrastructure are just a few of the numerous advantages of choosing to send your child to an international school. They provide hands-on learning that engages all five senses, and enhances cognitive, physical, social development and emotional aspects. The following parameters will help in making an informed decision regarding school selection from the plethora of available options: Interdisciplinary Approach – What type of programmes does the school have in place? An international school must include integrative learning to make well-rounded individuals. Ideally, they should offer extracurricular activities such as the performing arts, writing, sports, and many others. Small Class Sizes – Typically the class sizes in international schools are small to medium, which ensures high student-teacher interaction. Even better are schools that consciously limit the class-size to a maximum of 15-20 to allow personalised mentoring and support. Collaboration and partnerships – Schools that have the partnerships with research institutions, overseas universities and businesses thereby giving students a chance to work with on projects and academic research opens up real world experience before they graduate from school. Exposure and future ready – Does the school give the students a platform for future thinking through sociological ideation or design thinking and technology skills? Community work – How much does the school expose the students to solving the problems of the community around the school? Does the school offer social reconstructionist dialogues and a platform for student advocacy? It is quite crucial for both students and parents to understand the different boards, the pros and cons when looking at moving to a higher level of education. It is not a simple black-and-white solution. Each student is an individual, and good institutes/boards are what will ensure they reach their maximum potential.

Higher education prospects open up due to flexibility in subjects that help a student experience a wider choice and apply to universities with a broader array of options such as liberal arts, design, and specialist sciences. University Grants Commission, through its division Association of International Universities (AIU), recognizes international boards paving the way to all national universities, including the centralised entrance examination such as IIT and NEET. Prakriti recently conducted a webinar that discussed the higher education prospects, both in India and abroad, after Cambridge A Levels and IBDP. The recording is available here. (b) Futurist Pedagogy International boards are learner-centered. These systems encourage research, creativity and give equal importance to activity-based learning as to learning of abstract concepts. International boards are far more aligned to technology-based and project-based learning. The technological courses offered such as Design and Technology in IGCSE and Product & Digital Design in IB are about developing solutions such as an application or a robotic function. (c) Focus on Skills vs Knowledge International boards turn students into global citizens by exposing them to a diverse array of backgrounds and cultures. The programmes such as ‘Global Perspective’ under Cambridge lower secondary course inculcates critical thinking about topics with a global perspective. While the languages courses build an appreciation of world literature, the other subjects emphasize on examining and analysing issues and validating ideas with research. (d) Small class size and personalized approach A higher level of personalized attention is required, especially during the primary years of growth. International curriculum provides small class sizes which provide the opportunity of learning at one’s pace and the set of strengths of the individual student. Cambridge IGCSE vs IB in India The Cambridge system is among the finest, preparing school students for life by fostering informed curiosity and a lifelong love of studying. Cambridge qualifications are internationally recognised, have a strong reputation and will hold its value throughout a person’s educational and professional career. There are clear merits of Cambridge over IB, especially with respect to subject flexibility, economics and popularity in India. The former enjoys a structured curriculum which alleviates the pressure over teachers in designing the curriculum over the latter. IB requires one to take Sciences and Math whereas IGCSE awards can happen without either. IB schools are more expensive because of the multiple workshops offered and the requirement of greater resources to develop the programme efficiently. IGCSE is seen as a more affordable alternative than IB in India as availability of trained teachers for IB and the affiliation requirements makes it more expensive than the IGCSE requirements. What to look for when choosing an international school? Innovative adaptations in curriculum, outstanding teachers, cultural exposure, and supporting infrastructure are just a few of the numerous advantages of choosing to send your child to an international school. They provide hands-on learning that engages all five senses, and enhances cognitive, physical, social development and emotional aspects. The following parameters will help in making an informed decision regarding school selection from the plethora of available options: Interdisciplinary Approach – What type of programmes does the school have in place? An international school must include integrative learning to make well-rounded individuals. Ideally, they should offer extracurricular activities such as the performing arts, writing, sports, and many others. Small Class Sizes – Typically the class sizes in international schools are small to medium, which ensures high student-teacher interaction. Even better are schools that consciously limit the class-size to a maximum of 15-20 to allow personalised mentoring and support. Collaboration and partnerships – Schools that have the partnerships with research institutions, overseas universities and businesses thereby giving students a chance to work with on projects and academic research opens up real world experience before they graduate from school. Exposure and future ready – Does the school give the students a platform for future thinking through sociological ideation or design thinking and technology skills? Community work: How much does the school expose the students to solving the problems of the community around the school? Does the school offer social reconstructionist dialogues and a platform for student advocacy? It is quite crucial for both students and parents to understand the different boards, the pros and cons when looking at moving to a higher level of education. It is not a simple black-and-white solution. Each student is an individual, and good institutes/boards are what will ensure they reach their maximum potential.

Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts. Click here to read more about MannanA Campus Enriched by Nature's BountyOur landscape is a vibrant testament to our commitment to biodiversity and natural beauty. Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious",

यदि हाँ…………! तो बनाइए संतुलन प्रकृति व मानव के बीच……… ताकि वे एक-दूसरे के मित्र बनें, – न कि दुश्मन।’ जान्हवी कार्तिक ( कक्षा- 10) विद्यार्थियों के लिए मोबाइल के प्रयोग पर प्रतिबन्ध होना चाहिए अथवा नहीं? इस तथ्य से कोई इनकार नहीं है कि मोबाइल फोन उपयोगी गैजेट हैं। वे हमारे रोजमर्रा के जीवन में कईतरीकों से हमारी मदद करते हैं, जिससे यह आसान और सुविधाजनक हो जाता है। मोबाइल फोन एक संचारउपकरण है, जिसे अक्सर “सेल फोन” भी कहा जाता है। यह मुख्य रूप से आवाज संचार के लिए उपयोगकिया जाने वाला उपकरण है, जिससे वीडियो कॉल करने, इंटरनेट सर्फ करने, गेम खेलने, उच्च रिज़ॉल्यूशन केचित्र लेने और यहां तक ​​कि अन्य प्रासंगिक गैजेट को नियंत्रित करने में सक्षम हो गया है। मोबाइल फोन आज इतने उपयोगी हो गए हैं कि, उन्होंने वास्तव में लैपटॉप और अन्य बड़े गैजेट्स के उपयोग को बदल दिया है। आज, लोग ई-मेल भेजते हैं, इंटरनेट ब्राउज़ करते हैं, सोशल मीडियाअकाउंट्स, पावर पॉइंट प्रेजेंटेशन का प्रबंधन करते हैं, गणना करते हैं, और अपने स्मार्ट फोन काउपयोग करके बहुत कुछ करते हैं। विद्यार्थियों के लिए मोबाइल फोन का अत्यधिक प्रयोग उचित नहीं है| अनावश्यक मुद्दों पर मोबाइल फोन पर लंबी अवधि के लिए बात करना और अनावश्यक चलचित्र देखना भी एक प्रकार का दुरुपयोग है। डॉक्टरों ने बार-बार चेतावनी दी है कि मोबाइल फोन का निरंतर और अत्यधिक उपयोग स्वास्थ्य के लिए हानिकारक है। इससे बच्चों का मानसिक विकास रुक जाताहै और पूरे व्यक्तित्व पर नकारात्मक प्रभाव पड़ता है| यह संदेह से परे है कि मोबाइल फोन विद्यार्थियों के दैनिक जीवन के लिए उपयोगी और आवश्यकगैजेट है। मोबाइल फोन के बिना, जीवन व्यक्तिगत रूप से और साथ ही पेशेवर रूप से कठिनहोगा। लेकिन, मोबाइल फोन हमारी रोजमर्रा की जिंदगी में उपयोग किए जाने के बावजूद हमेंइसके दुरुपयोग से भी अवगत होना चाहिए। जब उचित रूप से उपयोग नहीं किया जाता है तोमोबाइल फोन के स्वास्थ्य और सुरक्षा को लेकर खतरनाक परिणाम हो सकते हैं। खनक कुमार (कक्षा-10)\n\n\n\n--- Substack Article ---\nCan We Save the Planet or Should We Save Ourselves?

Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts. Click here to read more about MannanA Campus Enriched by Nature's BountyOur landscape is a vibrant testament to our commitment to biodiversity and natural beauty. Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious",

    "main_content": "Summer Jamboree 2020 by Prakriti | Jun 28, 2020 Like every year, we had organised Summer Jamboree, this year it had to be online but no less enthralling. The programme included several stimulating experiences such as a Film Appreciation Club, Book Reading Circle, Chess Skills, Story and art sessions, Latin Jazz as well as method theatre through Play a Tale. The details of the programmes are as follows. We had participation from over 100 children about 40% of which were outside of Prakriti. The parents and learners have provided glowing feedback to the quality of the programme that we would like to share. Anek Ramayan : In this 10 hour Online workshop, our eminent storyteller Ms. Jaishree Sethi, shared folk stories culled from different Ramayanas existing across India, She also taught new words from different languages like Marathi, Hindi, Bengali through these stories, while our reputed artist-Shri Ramlal Bhatt, made intriguing regional crafts themed on Ramayana. It was a lesson to learn new words, new stories and crafts; and yet go back and learn an age old culture. Film Appreciation : We watched 8 movies before our online meetings. We met in a small group of at most 15 students for 60 minutes, 8 times over a month, for young learners to express their expressions and learning. We watched Arrietty, The Lorax, Blue Umbrella, My Name is Kalam, The Little Prince, Free Willy and Kiki’s Delivery Service. Naveen Vasudevan, a cultural enthusiast and an Auroville resident conducted the workshop and engaged children in an open and fearless dialogue. Prakriti Book Club : We read the two books online with Ms Meenakshi Puri, English language facilitator (ex Sardar Patel Vidyalaya) and a litterateur. In this book reading circle of 4 weeks, the facilitator traversed with young learners into the lives of the characters in these books and cultivated a life-long love for reading different genres. The members of the club read Look into my Eyes by Lauren Child and A Village by the Sea by Anita Desai. I Can… : Prakriti Day Care team has curated a creative combination of Non-Fire Cooking, Creating Crafts, Playful Workouts for our young ones. Children enjoyed the fun of working independently with two activities each day. Play a tale : This role play/theatre workshop was organised by Prakriti in collaboration with Third Space Collective. Our practices relied on *Social Emotional Learning (SEL)* and the *creative field of performance arts* to explore the intricacies of the world through drama with children of all ages, especially in trying times such as these. Our learners understands how to manage emotions, set and achieve positive goals, feel and show empathy for others, manage and establish positive relationships and make responsible decisions. The attribute to articulate well, will make their personalities shine as they grow up. Prakriti Chess School : Strategic games require the players to use autonomous decision-making skills, while providing continuous stimulation to their brain cells. Indeed ! Exercising the brain is as imperative as exercising the body. We organised a Chess Foundation course of 8 classes and 4 tournaments, coached by International Masters CRG Krishna and Mila Zarkovic. Dance in Summer : Prakriti Team collaborated with Gilles Chuyen, french dancer and choreographer for 12 classes across 6 weeks to train learners in Modern Dance on the theme of Nature and Latin Jazz. To make the class exciting for the learners, it began with gentle warm-up exercises and body isolation followed by the choreography. Dancers wanted to move freely and naturally, so they set themselves free from pointy shoes and grasp the floor with bare feet. Dance gave expression to their inner feelings. How beautiful indeed! Stories and Crafts : Prakriti has been organising reading picnics with purposeful stories that fuel imagination and build connections with nature. This summer, for our young children, we had come up with a Stories + Craft workshop. The focus was five elements of Earth, Water, Fire, Earth and Air. We aimed to appeal to the senses of the children around these elements, by shaping ideas. With an eminent storyteller Vasudha Ahuja – a certified storyteller from Kathala, this was a highly enriching experience for all our participants. Vasudha Didi takes our little bundles of joy into a world of imagination and engages them with art, craft and new learnings. Code and Build : Our young learners enjoyed the coding and building sessions. Learners were introduced to Mobile Programming, 3D Design and Modelling and Web Programming. In each module learners started and completed micro projects like Paint your photo app, Mole mash app to name a few. Aayansh's aquarium ??thank you for the activity Inara loved the salad. Ate it too. Made a tomato free version for her cousin. She loved it too. Ivaan helping Mishka with the exercises today ? Netra loved it and so did the entire family. Zoya had an awesome time making these absolutely yummy cucumber boats ????. She loved eating these too! Tvisha-Very interesting activity. Thank you? Netra's aquarium ,she loved it and tried to cut and make her own fish Anayh's aquarium?very interesting activity, Anayh had fun? \"Very interesting storytelling sessions. Wish I could take a break from office work and enjoy these!” “Some very lovely Hanuman drawings seen here. children can do such caricatures in no time when they are enthused.” “I must say the story telling is super. Kids are totally engrossed (and let me add sheepishly as am I on the side)!” “Dhun's story from Ramayan. These sessions were a great hit. Dhun thoroughly enjoyed the sessions both stories n puppet making. Can these not be extended till holidays last” Thank you for taking the children on this experiential journey of movies. Vihaan loved every session. Thank you for the wonderful classes Naveen. It was a great concept and Navya has been enjoying every session. In fact, she always looked forward to the session. Thank you for engaging children in such an innovative way. Thanku Naveen Sir for teaching children how to watch movies with a new perspective\n\n\n\n--- Substack Article ---\nCan We Save the Planet or Should We Save Ourselves? Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint.

    "main_content": "Presentation of Art Learning by Rainbow Group (Grade 2) by Prakriti | Nov 2, 2020 Last month, the learners of Rainbow Group culminated their learning on mini art projects that developed organically. We began learning art under the theme: Patterns. The aim of engaging children in Mini project was to explore patterns around them through Block Printing, Optical Illusion art and Bandhani Art. We wanted children to research these things at their own pace. We first introduced Block Printing in the class. They were shown a variety of blocks and how blocks can also be created with everyday objects. Asynchronous learning was one of the objectives of our Mini Project. Google slides, video, pictures and relevant information were shared with Rainbow Group on Google Classroom. Everything related to Block Printing, Bandhani art and Optical Illusion art was shared via Google classroom. The children took up this project at their own pace of learning. After going through the shared materials by the facilitator, the children submitted their work to us. Our co-partners, the parents, played a vital role here. They were the ones who spent most of the time with the children at home. The children were facilitated by their parents at home. To conclude Mini projects, we set up a Presentation of Learning for our children wherein they had to present their work and any research findings in front of the group. Rainbow Group’s Presentation of Learning was a sight to behold. The children showed their work and explained everything beautifully. We are looking forward to doing more Mini projects in the future with our children. Outcome/Achievement: The mini project was all about patterns. Through this Mini Project , the children could dive deeper into this subject: Patterns. They not only explored patterns but also came up with novel ideas to create more patterns themselves; be it experimenting with different color patterns in Bandhani art or creating their own blocks for Block printing or perceiving and then creating the Optical art illusion. Their new ideas could be reflected in their work, for instance, Choosing sindoor or haldi for pink and yellow color respectively for Bandhani art. They could see and link patterns with everyday objects. Their imagination was revived as we only gave them an initiation point, rest of the thinking in the process came from their end.\n\n\n\n--- Substack Article ---\nCan We Save the Planet or Should We Save Ourselves? Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts. Click here to read more about MannanA Campus Enriched by Nature's BountyOur landscape is a vibrant testament to our commitment to biodiversity and natural beauty. Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious",

    "title": "Project: My City (Grade 5) - Prakriti",
    "description": "",
    "main_content": "Project: My City (Grade 5) by Prakriti | Dec 13, 2020 Knowing about the city one is living in is the most important thing. It is important for children to know about their surroundings politically, geographically and historically . This project was undertaken to let students record facts about their city and know about the city they are living in. We started the project by focusing on the terms and vocabulary related to geography that have to be dealt in the project for example landmarks, landforms, etc. Then we discussed map related vocabulary such as title, source, scale, gridlines, etc. Then we discussed the physical geography in which we talked about mountains, valleys, plains , plateaus, etc. and instead of feeding the students directly with the definitions of these they were asked to derive and understand the definitions on their own by seeing the pictures or videos. After this there was a debate held in the class on the topic “which place is more suitable for crop farming, plains or mountains” before the debate certain parameters were identified as a class on the basis of which the debate can be held some of these parameters were sources of water, quantity of crop, danger from animals,etc. After this we moved on to reading the map of Noida. Since most of the students of our school are from Noida therefore we started from this. The students were given the map of Noida to have a detailed look, then they were given a worksheet they were asked to reflect on the following questions-: Why do you think this map was made? What information does this map give you about Noida? Do you think this map is helpful? Why? Why not? How would you have made this map? What are some of the features of this map? This gave students a detailed overview about the map of their city, also about the benefits of Map. After this the students were given a text on “geography of Noida” which helped them to know their city well, the text was about, what all districts are there in Noida, what all villages are there and how many are there and where they are, the climate of Noida, etc. After this we came to Delhi, and the students were given a video on “Timeline of Delhi”, this video showed how Delhi used to be earlier before the development, how it used to look like, what vehicles were used, how roads used to be, etc. along with this certain words were given to the students and they had to find meanings to them and write that in their own words. From here we moved on to “the birth of a city”. The students were given a text on “Birth of a city” from the book “the lonely planet”, this book talks about how a city was formed from a village, it talks about recreation and culture where it shows why museums/ parks/gardens were made by the city planners, how they wanted the future cities to be, life under the ground like subways, sewers, etc. the whole book was read chapter wise according to the topics picked up during the theme so that detailed and in-depth discussions could be made Before the class students were provided with the chapter of the book which talks about the birth of the city so that they can read the text before the class and discussions could be made during the class. This text gave students an overview about how a city is formed, and the formation of a metropolis city from a village. This text gave an understanding about how buildings are formed, what is there in them that hold them for many years, what materials and what machines are used to make huge buildings, how the planners of the city had planned the city in a way so that people have places where they can hang-on, they have made cafes, museums, stadiums, etc., then it showed different types of houses, it showed different workers and work types, etc. students were given a space to explore and observe how and why things, buildings, museums, gardens, etc. are made and why were they made. Along with the text vocabulary building was also looked at, whenever students encountered any difficult word they were asked to stop on that word and derive the meaning of the word on their own by re-reading the text and form a definition on their own. The definitions formed by them were also written on the PowerPoint presentation so that every child can read and write the definition, this led to oral and written communication. These new words were better understood by the students as they derived the meaning on their own. Then we moved to a topic in which students were asked what are some of the problems faced by our city today they gave many pointers such as poverty, overcrowded, more air pollution, corruption, etc. Based on this students were given an assignment in which they were asked how they want their future city to look like the answers written by students were marvelous, they actually went through a deep thought process to answer this question. Since Metro has become the most used public transport therefore after having a discussion on the birth and formation of a city we moved to Metro and its map. There was a discussion on Metro followed by a detailed discussion on its map and students were given a worksheet on the map of Metro and were asked questions from the map which required great observation of the map. Then we moved to a topic in which students were asked what are some of the problems faced by our city today they gave many pointers such as poverty, overcrowded, more air pollution,corruption,etc based on this students were given an assignment in which they were asked how they want their future city to look like the answers written by students were marvelous, they actually went through a deep thought process to answer this question. From here we moved on to the monuments in Delhi and the students were asked to choose a monument of their own choice and give a detailed presentation on it, they were given a few days so as to make a detailed presentation. Students had to make the presentation on the following parameters-: History of the monument (When was it built, Why was it built, What is it called, Why is it called so, Where is it located) Importance of the monument Some interesting facts about the monument – Who made it? Why? Special features of the monument – carvings, scripts, architecture, infrastructure, shape, size, materials used Personal experience of visiting the place Students did a very detailed research and the presentations made by them were brilliant, they took help from the facilitator, parents, grandparents, web search, and their own experiences while visiting that monument. Students were given their time to present the monument in the class and the whole class had to be led by them, the other students were asking various questions from the presenter. Students had their space to share what all they have researched and others could ask any question around the presentation, this gave a scope for peer learning, the students also made the pictures of the monument that they chose. After this we moved on to the history of Delhi monument by monument. Before the class students were given texts on the history of Delhi, these texts were focused towards the cities of Delhi and the dynasty ruling there history of the ruler as well, etc. We moved from dynasty to dynasty and started from the very first city which was Indraprastha, During the class discussion was made on the following pointers-: City of Delhi (Dynasty) Key Rulers Defeated/ Succeeded by Key Monuments/ Architecture Interesting Facts (At least 2) During the discussion the presenter of the monument of that city was also giving in their points which they read during the research of the monument. The students were imagining during the presentation that if they would have been born in that time then they would have been ruling a city and they would be having a throne to handle. This project gave students a space to research about the facts of their city, history of Delhi, monuments, and formation of a city, during this project students developed mapping skills, observation skills, questioning skills, etc.\n\n\n\n--- Substack Article ---\nCan We Save the Planet or Should We Save Ourselves?

Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts. Click here to read more about MannanA Campus Enriched by Nature's BountyOur landscape is a vibrant testament to our commitment to biodiversity and natural beauty. Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious",

Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun.

    "main_content": "Water Wonders: Grade 1 by Prakriti | Dec 11, 2021 Thematic learning helps students draw connections from the real world by integrating fun learning activities inspired from surroundings (e.g. ecosystem, atmosphere etc.) The activities compel children to think, problem-solve, develop gross /fine motor skills while pushing their imaginations in a cooperative role-playing to understand concepts in independence To deepen their understanding of the role of water in everyday lives, an authentic, fun-filled series of programs themed “Wonderful Water” was designed for the month. All streams of studies like language, mathematics, and arts were interlinked through various project tasks to enable them to showcase their understanding of the subject matter. The theme started with a story “ सूरज गया पानी में ‘‘, a fun filled prose about the sun’s reaction when it comes in contact with water. Post session, children shared their own experiences and fun moments of playing with water on several occasions. They also undertook an activity of piercing pencils through a water-filled zip lock pouch and observed its flowing characteristics.They shared their understanding in correlation to the pursuit and experiences from everyday observations. The fact that water is colorless was ascertained logically when they mixed various colors in water and found that water assimilates or assumes the color mixed in it.Similarly, they discovered that water is shapeless as it takes the shape of the vessel it is contained in. The students explored another feature of water which they experienced, as they prepared and tasted lemonade which helped them to come to the conclusion that water is tasteless Their knowledge was further enhanced by knowing about various forms of water. For this, learners were given a task of making their own Fruit Ice Lollipop by crushing the fruits of their choice and putting them in an ice tray with water in the refrigerator. They observed that after a few hours the water and fruits were frozen and turned into a solid form. Learners enjoyed having their Fruit Lollipops and from their observations, they concluded that water has unique properties and can exist in different forms, i.e. solid, liquid and gaseous state.As a follow-up assignment, learners created a colored bubble mix to observe and report the key characteristics and behaviour of the bubbles formed. For example, the formation of bubbles was observed to be hollow white spheres with an iridescent surface. Questions regarding micro structures and structural coloration were also briefly discussed. Image R.H.S is of Bubble Painting It encourages experimentation, creativity, and is lots of relaxing fun! Learner’s were made conscious of varied uses of water around them in everyday activities like bathing, washing hands, cooking, washing utensils, cleaning floors etc. They learnt to appreciate the importance of water in their daily lives which followed the discussions around reusing and saving water. Learners offered various solutions that they would like to implement in their daily routine to save water and created books related to the same. To continue the theme over the weekend , learners were encouraged to undertake simple experiments at home and document their observations to be presented during the school hours. The napkin siphon experiment was one to understand “Capillary action” in which interconnected fiber napkins bridging over several water filled glasses siphoned water from one glass to other due to gravity.Similarly, learners also did a“Walking Water ” experiment, where they filled half of their glasses with colored water and kept one empty glass in between two colored water glasses. They then kept tissue paper, one tissue paper in two glasses and observed the movement of water from one glass to the other through tissue papers. Learners also got the opportunity to try hands in Paper Chromatography where they observed splitting of a color into various other colors when dipped in water and enjoyed the activity. हिंदी भाषा की कक्षा वाले दिन भी, जल (पानी) थीम की शुरुआत एक उचित, आकर्षक और सुनहरे बरसात वाले दिन से हुई | जहाँ सभी के घरों के बाहर झमा-झम बरसात हो रही थी, वहीं बच्चों ने भी अपनी हथेली और उँगलियों की मदद से बारिश की आवाज़ बनाई | कैसे ? यहाँ बच्चों ने अपनी एक हाथ की हथेली को खोला, उसके बाद दूसरे हाथ की पहली ऊँगली ली और उसको हथेली पर मारा, फिर एक और ऊँगली ली, फिर एक और, और फिर एक, और ऐसे धीरे-धीरे करते हुए आवाज़ बढ़ती गई और कक्षा में भी झमा-झम बारिश का आनंद लिया गया | ‘पानी’ शब्द से बच्चों के मन में कौन-कौन से दृश्य आते हैं, इस बारे में भी चर्चा की गई | इस बात पर बच्चों के अनुभव कुछ इस प्रकार थे – झरना, मेंढ़क का पानी में कूदना, बारिश वाला गाना, पानी में उछलना, पानी को टपकते देखना, छाता, बरसाती, नाव, पूल पार्टी, छमछम, छपाक और भी बहुत कुछ | बच्चों ने ‘पानी’ (फिरकी) से जुड़ी एक कविता भी की और अपने घर और आस-पास, इस बात की भी खोज की कि पानी कहाँ-कहाँ पर है – और उन्होंने पाया – बोतल में, पानी की टंकी में, घड़े में, स्विमिंग पूल में और भी अन्य जगह | साथ ही साथ बच्चों ने पानी की तरह-तरह की आवाज़ को पहचाना, वह आवाज़ उन्हें कहाँ से आई, इस बारे में भी बताया | नीचे दिए गए चित्रों की तरह : बरसात आए और अपने साथ तूफ़ान न लाए ? ऐसा कम देखने को मिलता है | और तूफ़ान जब आए तब घोंघा न दिखे ? यह नामुमकिन लगता है | एक तूफ़ान वाले दिन हमारी कक्षा में कहानी के रूप में आया था – “सुनुसुनु घोंघा-बगीचे में तूफ़ान” (तूलिका) —- आया ! आया ! सुनुसुनु आया – मेर्री ग्रुप से मिलने आया | तूफ़ान में हम सभी अपना बचाव करने के उपाय ढूंढते हैं | लेकिन कैसे ? आइए देखते हैं कुछ रचनाएं हमारे दोस्तों द्वारा:बरसात आए और कश्ती का गीत न गाया जाए और कश्ती को पानी में तैराया न जाए ! क्या ऐसा हो सकता है ? नहीं न ? दोस्तों ने सुंदर-सुंदर कश्तियां बनाने के बाद; डगमग-डगमग हो के, कभी इधर तो कभी उधर जा के – ‘एक छोटी कश्ती मेरे पास ‘ कविता क बरसात के दिनों में बादल भी दिलचस्प और तरह-तरह के रूपों में दिखाई देते हैं – काले और घने, उमड़-घुमड़ के रूई के जैसे | कोई बादल मोर का रूप ले लेते हैं तो कोई हाथी का, तो कुछ काली-सफ़ेद बिल्लियाँ | हमारे दोस्तों ने भी आसमान में बादलों की सैर की (कहानी – बादलों में देखा – फिरकी ) और बादल के तरह-तरह के रूपों को भी पहचाना और नीचे दिए गए चित्रों के माध्यम से दर्शाया: बरसात के दिनों जब बूँदें गिरती है तब वो हमें कहीं-कहीं पर अटकी हुई नज़र भी आती हैं | लेकिन कहाँ ? तारों में, कपड़े टाँगने वाली रस्सी पर और न जाने कहाँ-कहाँ | साथ ही साथ यह बूँदें अटकी कैसे होंगी और वे नीचे क्यों नहीं गिरती, इस बात पर आपने भी कभी सोचा है ? हमारे दोस्तों ने इन मज़ेदार सवालों के अवलोकन को ध्यान में रखते हुए “बूँदें अटकी – इकतारा” कविता पर भी कार्य किया और इस कविता का खूब आनंद लिया | बरसात में भीगने से बचने के लिए छाते का होना ज़रूरी हो जाता है | हम सभी ने “लाल छतरी – तूलिका” कहानी के माध्यम से तरह-तरह के जानवरों को छाते में आते हुए पढ़ा और कहानी के अंत में उस छाते को उड़ते हुए भी देखा | बहुत बार ऐसा भी होता है कि हमारे पास छाता तो एक है लेकिन उसमें आने वाले लोग ज़्यादा हो जाते हैं | इस परिस्तिथि में हम किस-किस को अपने छाते के अंदर बुलाना चाहेंगे ? आओ जानते हैं नीचे दिए गए कुछ चित्रों के द्वारा : ज़रूरी नहीं हम वही छतरी को काम में लें जो हमें बज़ार से मिलती हो | कभी ऐसा भी हो सकता है कि हमें अपने आस-पास की चीज़ों से छाता तैयार करना हो, जैसे कि “छुन-छुन की छतरी” प्रथम – कहानी में भी हुआ था | हमारे दोस्त नीचे दिए गए चित्रों की मदद से आपको कुछ उपाय देना चाहेंगे : आपने कभी बारिश को पकड़ने की कोशिश की है ? या फिर वह पानी जो कहीं से टपक रहा हो या बह रहा हो | कैसे? हमारे दोस्तों ने इन मज़ेदार तरीकों से बारिश को पकड़ा और “चलो ! बारिश पकड़ें – तूलिका” कहानी का आनंद लिया | कार्य को आगे बढ़ाते हुए दोस्तों ने अपनी स्वयं की किताब की भी रचना की, जिसके लेखक और चित्रकार वे खुद थे| कहानी के माध्यम से उन्होंने बताया कि वे पानी को किसमें जमा करना पसंद करेंगे और उस जमा किए हुए पानी को कहाँ उपयोग में भी लाएंगे | इसके अलावा हम सभी ने मिलकर चार सामूहिक कहानियों की भी रचना की | “चाँद की रोटी” – इकतारा कविता में चाँद की एक रोटी पानी में आ जाती है और उसी पानी में जो मछली होती है वह फिर भी उस रोटी को नहीं खा पाती | क्या आपने भी देखी है ऐसी ख़ास रोटी ? हमारे मेर्री ग्रुप के दोस्तों ने इस कविता को आगे बढ़ाते हुए कुछ उपाय दिए, जैसे कि : मछली फिर गई अपने दोस्तों के पास और लग गई खेलने; मछली ने अपने दोस्तों से बातें की कि यह रोटी है क्या चीज़; मछली ने ज़ोर से रोटी पर छलांग लगाई और रोटी थोड़ी डगमगाई; और अगर मछली रोटी खा न पाई तो शायद वह रोटी परछाई है ? अंत में, पानी के आस-पास इतनी कविताएं और कहानियां करने के बाद हम सभी ने यह जानने की कोशिश की कि पानी गीला क्यों होता है ? मेर्री ग्रुप के दोस्तों ने साझा किया कि, क्यूंकि – बादल गीले होते हैं, इसलिए; क्यूंकि पानी liquid होता है, इसलिए; क्यूंकि पानी नेचर से आया है और नेचर गीला होता है, इसलिए; क्यूंकि आसमान गीला होता है, इसलिए; क्यूंकि पानी ठोस नहीं है और न ही पानी रुई के जैसा मुलायम है, पानी तो बीच का है, इसलिए; क्यूंकि पानी पतला होता है, इसलिए और भी अनेक-अनेक रोचक कारणों की वजह से पानी गीला होता है | During the Art sessions, we took inspiration from water to learn more about it through self expression. Learners were encouraged to imagine themselves underwater and created their underwater portraits with details as wide as their imaginations! They also got an opportunity to make their own boats and when they came to school for the first time, they went on a pond hunt which looked similar to their drawing of water lilies and other flora.They floated their boats in the pond and it was a joyous experience for all. Learners also created their own windmills and played with them. Learners made their posters to spread the message of saving water. To give them an exposure of marine life, learners created their waterfall and various water creatures which are magically visible in the light beam.\n\n\n\n--- Substack Article ---\nCan We Save the Planet or Should We Save Ourselves? Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts. Click here to read more about MannanA Campus Enriched by Nature's BountyOur landscape is a vibrant testament to our commitment to biodiversity and natural beauty. Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious",

    "main_content": "A Literary Visit to Gandhi Smriti by Prakriti | Aug 13, 2021 Our middle school learners were at Gandhi Smriti today to learn language skills in the context of an important freedom movement. Britishers had forced upon Indigo plantation on Indian farmers for their commercial pursuit that led to starvation and uprising of farmers in Bengal (1858) and later in Champaran, Bihar (1917) under Gandhiji’s leadership. Today marked an important step in their appreciation of the movement and many Gandhian ideas. Every child brought a story about a significant individual or an event related to independence. An appreciation of the context was made by reading the following poetry and sketching the emotion expressed. Indigo BY CHITRA BANERJEE DIVAKARUNI Benegal, 1779-1859 The fields flame with it, endless, blue as cobra poison. It has entered our blood and pulses up our veins like night. There is no other color. The planter’s whip splits open the flesh of our faces, a blue liquid light trickles through the fingers. Blue dyes the lungs when we breathe. Only the obstinate eyes refuse to forget where once the rice parted the earth’s moist skin and pushed up reed by reed, green, then rippled gold like the Arhiyal’s waves. Stitched into our eyelids, the broken dark, the torches of the planter’s men, fire walling like a tidal wave over our huts, ripe charred grain that smelled like flesh. And the wind screaming in the voices of women dragged to the plantation, feet, hair, torn breasts. In the worksheds, we dip our hands, their violent forever blue, in the dye, pack it in great embossed chests for the East India Company. Our ankles gleam thin blue from the chains. After that night many of the women killed themselves. Drowning was the easiest. Sometimes the Arhiyal gave us back the naked, swollen bodies, the faces eaten by fish. We hold on to red, the color of their saris, the marriage mark on their foreheads, we hold it carefully inside our blue skulls, like a man in the cold Paush night holds in his cupped palms a spark, its welcome scorch, feeds it his foggy breath till he can set it down in the right place, to blaze up and burst like the hot heart of a star over the whole horizon, a burning so beautiful you want it to never end.\n\n\n\n--- Substack Article ---\nCan We Save the Planet or Should We Save Ourselves?

    "main_content": "Virtual Science Fair by Prakriti | Mar 17, 2021 Our learners of Grade 6-8 presented their observations in Science through their experiments and creative ideas in a virtual science fair. They performed these experiments live and discussed the results against the hypotheses. See our young scientists in action\n\n\n\n--- Substack Article ---\nCan We Save the Planet or Should We Save Ourselves? Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts. Click here to read more about MannanA Campus Enriched by Nature's BountyOur landscape is a vibrant testament to our commitment to biodiversity and natural beauty. Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it.

Learning is about becoming- who I might be. Learning is also highly social” Peter Senge, Professor at MIT and Author of The Fifth Discipline “Mind should be consulted in its growth. Education goes from Near to Far” Sri Aurobindo What do we want our children to be?We want our children to be...It is said that a 21st century learner should be curious, imaginative, oratorical and open-minded. We say simply, that children should grow to be happy. Happiness begins with freedom to explore and choose. It lasts with the feeling of selfless giving, i.e., loving kindness. Education should be joyful and make learners kind towards others and the environment. What does freedom mean for a learner?Free thinkers need to be free learnersChildren should be free to learn what they like to learn and in the way they learn the best. The role of a teacher or a parent is to reconnect a child’s personality with the inner swabhav or prakriti. A school should be the safe space to explore the learning domains and express freely. With this freedom, children also learn what they need to.

Confused about the modalities and complexities of home schooling, we chanced upon Prakriti. One visit to the school, and we both fell in love with the space and the concept. The last 8 years have only led to a reinforcement of our faith. Prakriti is a place where the children can just be – be free, be themselves, and become whoever or whatever they wish to be. As a medium of education, it has constantly encouraged our son to focus on conceptual understanding, following a practical approach towards learning. At an individual level, Prakriti has enhanced his mental and emotional quotients. In the most amazing way, didis and bhaiyas have understood him deeply as a person, rather than just a face in a crowded class. This has paved the way for his holistic development, and not merely academic growth. Prakriti has provided a stimulating atmosphere with games, music, art and meditation – teaching him to be independent and be able to think for himself. Even we, as parents, have matured, thanks to relentless focus on a synchronised home environment. Group sessions, as well as one-to-one counselling have been a constant feature in our lives. Prakriti, for us, is not just school, it is a community. And our younger one, too, has been added to it recently. Borrowing a line from the Prakriti anthem (ideated by my 2-year old), “Bachhon ke naam hain anek, ek naam hai Prakriti”. Arunima Jain Mother-Ivaan (unity group) & Mishka (Red Group) I’m privileged to give my below testimonial for our Prakriti: Prakriti has a deep meaning as it reflects “Nature” its serenity and happiness to be on its own, henceforth what else could be better to up bring our kids under the blessings of Nature such that they may transform not only to an educated and learned person but importantly they learn to learn the process of learning . The way kids name their group y-o-y basis is a true reflection of that they have become inherent part of our nature as given by their own Prakriti. The way they learn new things and use them in their day to day life is phenomenal as then they have imbibed the learning and not only learnt to forget subsequently , I always say with conviction that things we learn from nature like swimming is something one will never forget in his /her life , similarly what kids learn and grow with under shelters of Prakriti is incredible and unforgettable not only the learning but the way they have learned it . The way Prakriti infuses the technological advancement is an exemplification of their vision and the efforts they put in to bring this so simplistically and seamlessly is classic case of their being grounded to nature as nature is actually simple , we human beings make it so complicated and cumbersome to satisfy ourselves only. The pedagogy adopted by Prakriti not only helps our kids to gradually grow and start questioning to explore reasons , do research and get into discussions but immensely enables parents to keep up the pace with their way of learning and upkeep our learning zeal. We feel so proud to see how such kids get so comfortable in handling complicated topics and getting prepared to take on tasks with an open mind and bent of mind “agree to disagree”. What’s even more fascinating about the Prakriti is the integrated and cohesive approach which blends all aspects of overall development , the emphasis on to be strong by eating healthy and getting onto sporting activity even under limited resources and curtailed environment like the one we all are going through since Mar’20 under pandemic shows the affinity and broad vision of Prakriti which not only nurtures our kids but upping’s and enable them to tread their journey in this world facing all headwinds with courage and strength. Last but not the least the passion with which all Didi & Bhaiya’s get involved with our kids is something which we as parents couldn’t have imagined , their accessibility and binding with kids is overwhelming and nostalgic , their desire to bring-in new ways , give them exposure to explore awesome places , learn to be compassionate with the culture and lifestyle of natives , make kids relish the serenity of nature is beyond words and can only be felt just like nature which our kids do with enthu and are always excited for more and more . In nutshell I can say with conviction that if we are not part of Prakriti then we are keeping ur kids away from nature and if our kids aren’t bought-up under nature then we as parents can reflect back as how our upbringing has been and can very well answer to ourselves. So let me conclude by posing back few questions as “Why not Prakriti” ? “If not Prakriti then What “ ? “Are we not stealing best upbringing from our innocent kids by not keeping them under shelters of Prakriti”? I SAY FROM CORE OF MY HEART THAT LET PRAKRITI BLOSSOM AS ITS PRAKRITI WHICH WILL PREPARE / EMPOWER & LAUNCH OUR KIDS IN THIS WORLD TO BRING & SPREAD TRUE REJOICE AKIN TO NATURE Dheeraj Jain Father of Dhruv Jain (Grade VI) Prakriti is a way of life… When you join Prakriti, not only do you enrol your child, – you enrol yourself to a journey of learning and unlearning, to going back to the basics – to simple joys. Many memories rush to mind whenever someone asks about Prakriti, and to us few things have always stood out. We had just enrolled our child in pre-school program and were being briefed by Shilpa Didi, and she said, when we tell our children, “Pyar se” we should also softly, reassuringly touch the child while saying so. This tactile, soothing approach helps the child to calm down and experience those words in a holistic sensory way. This has been so-so helpful. No one teaches you how to be parents – but at Prakriti you get a chance to be good ones! The other has to be the Day care program. We had looked far and wide and never could settle on anything. In fact one renowned place had laughed at us when I asked what kind of stories they tell their 1.5 yrs old… When you embrace Prakriti, you inherit a village – the care, affection, attention that the children get in Day care is second to none. One day, I was trying to sleep with a migraine, my 5.5 yr old comes up and starts rubbing my forehead – “Deepa Didi aise hi karti thin jab hum so nahi paate the.” There is so much more that can be said. No words can do enough justice. The good part is that everyone “sees” your child. All you have to do is commit to the experience. Last but not the least will have to be how everyone addresses each other – Didi and Bhaiya. Allowing the child to be free of any hierarchy and bureaucracy teaches them the value of respect, and oneness that no lesson can teach. Sumi Tandon Mother of Vishnu Mehrotra (Grade 1) Six weeks have passed since Tej joined Alt school with Prakriti, and a day hasn’t gone by when he doesn’t eagerly await his LIVE learning sessions. I stress upon LIVE as the sessions truly bring learning to life. Whether it’s the weather that’s in discussion, or observing patterns in everything around, it has opened Tej to new and interesting ways of looking at life and at himself. The boy who was once intimidated and struggled to read past a page of a story book, today confidently reads 4-5 books a day, comprehends them, and has developed the ability to interpret the same. He keeps a daily journal recording his ‘inner weather’ which he proudly reads to us like a novella 🙂 All this in just 6 weeks! Learning/ teaching online can be challenging, yet the group discussions have lent space for individual thinking and have been active and lively; delivered with such patience and respect; while maintaining discipline at the same time. But most of all, Tej feels loved 🙂 A big shout of THANK YOU to Aditi and Mehak Didi’s for nurturing Tej and his peers with so much care, sensitivity and equanimity. The time Didi’s have spent beyond class hours to fix his matras and listen to his endless ramblings have not gone unnoticed, and is well appreciated. Tej feels at home with the two of you, and wonders when he might travel to meet you all in person 🙂 No doubt there is still a lot of ground to cover, but we are so thankful for a great start, and hope the program sustains even post lockdown. If we were to judge how wealthy we are on the happiness scale, Tej would be a millionaire! Thank you all for keeping his spark alive. Meera George Mother of Tej Matthew (Home School Support) When we started looking for a place where our child could settle down while the two of us went to work, we came across a number of places that made us realise that it was going to be a difficult task finding a good daycare for our son. Our search led us to Prakriti, which was just a few years old. There was something quite reassuring about this place from the moment we got there—and it had to do with its people, its architecture, its ethos and most importantly the way in which they interacted with children, whether they be four months old or six years old. Though they had never taken care of such small children, they agreed to be our partners on this journey. We have been with Prakriti for six years now and our son is very well settled here—it is practically his second home, he is so comfortable with the space and the people he interacts with in this space. Prakriti runs a very good daycare programme and we would recommend it to all parents who are looking for something similar. Shashank Singh Father of Angad (Grade 3) “Prakriti daycare is built in a very warm, cosy and close to nature space, with lots of lush greenery, a small habitat for animals like rabbits and fishes, and quite open play areas and enclosed ones. The daycare had become a second home to my toddler. It is indeed a place where as a parent I felt secure and glad to send my child, as it provided an environment where children feel loved, nurtured and free to explore their surroundings. The daycare staff is quite friendly and helpful, and they also provide healthy food to kids. “Keep growing Prakriti!” Sameer Bhatt Father of Anayh Bhatt (Day Care)\n\n--- Substack Article ---\nCan We Save the Planet or Should We Save Ourselves? Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts. Click here to read more about MannanA Campus Enriched by Nature's BountyOur landscape is a vibrant testament to our commitment to biodiversity and natural beauty. Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious",

Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts. Click here to read more about MannanA Campus Enriched by Nature's BountyOur landscape is a vibrant testament to our commitment to biodiversity and natural beauty. Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious",

    "main_content": "Service Learning Immersion at Kechala (Rural Orissa) by Prakriti | May 31, 2022 “By our stumbling the world is perfected” ― Sri Aurobindo Stumbling is essential, to look near, to look at the simple foundations we are racing upon and be conscious of our steps along the way. What we generally perceive stumbling as a roadblock is most often a detour to the infinite possibilities to rediscover ourselves. When our learners embarked on an arduous journey to rural Orissa it was a path lesser known, rather travelled. What we experienced was the power of simplicity and sincerity exemplified in every moment we lived in Auro Vidya Mandir, Kechla. The space welcomed us with enormous freedom & love. Children at the ashram were brimming with confidence & compassion. Their guidance, care & discussion was the most critical part of knowing more about the space. We could have never imagined a trek at night after dinner and that too without any light, that trust emboldened in our immediate nature, our own selves & people surrounding us. The adventure of sailing into unknown depths just strengthens that trust. When we were a part of the classrooms , it was a liberating experience where one can choose their pace of learning and peers , facilitators collectively facilitate that learning journey. Finally the community cooking attempt was fulfilling & the real joy of creating & sharing food all together was a key takeaway from our short yet beautiful time at Kechla What we observed and attempted to understand there is just the spark of thre-discovering our own selves and our surroundings.\n\n\n\n--- Substack Article ---\nCan We Save the Planet or Should We Save Ourselves? Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts. Click here to read more about MannanA Campus Enriched by Nature's BountyOur landscape is a vibrant testament to our commitment to biodiversity and natural beauty. Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious",

    "main_content": "I, My family and My home by Prakriti | May 28, 2021 An inter-disciplinary project undertaken by Grade 1 & Grade 2 in the first term Merry Group (Grade 1)Happy Group (Grade 2) Merry Group began its journey with the Project “Me, my family and my home”. The main objectives of this theme were to familiarize learners with their body parts and to explore their senses. With this project we also focussed on exploring their connection with their family members and explored their physical space around them. Languages, Mathematics and Arts were also interlinked with the Project and various aspects of the theme were catered in different subjects through various interesting activities. Continue Reading This theme talks about oneself, their connection with their family members/ friends and physical space i.e Home. Main objectives of this theme were : -To understand oneself better. -To be able to connect more with family members/friends. -To be able to explore and understand the physical space around them. Continue Reading v Reflections From Our Happy Group (Grade 2) There were several activities that were conducted under this theme. In Project, Happy Group began with their old photographs wherein they had to observe their own old self and mapped the growth between their old and present self. Self-Reflection is the key to self-awareness! The children took up the reflective activities remarkably, observed and reflected on their own selves, their own likes and dislikes, their growing abilities and so on. ‘मेरे अन्दर का मौसम’ was another activity that gave children an opportunity to observe, understand and reflect upon their feelings and emotions. My likes and dislikes Family members became an integral part of the project when the children shared about their families by sharing their family photographs with the group. They also created some beautiful poems about their family members and talked about their unique talents/skills. The children will be getting more opportunities through Summer Fun where they will take their project further by engaging in activities related to ‘My Home’. Things I can now do My inside weather (मेरे अंदर का मौसम) Helping my family members In English, children engaged in poems and stories such as ‘Now that I can read’ and ‘Why should I help you ?’ and shared how they helped their family members and friends. The Buddy Program was another interactive activity wherein the children were paired up with a buddy. They helped each other and thought of some innovative ways in which they could help each other in the near future. Reflection on what I learnt last year हम सभी को अपने पिटारे में कुछ न कुछ मज़ेदार चीजें रखने की आदत होती है | हिंदी में बच्चों के साथ ‘गुल्ली का गज़ब पिटारा’ – प्रथम द्वारा प्रकाशित कहानी को पढ़ा गया | बच्चों ने छोटे-छोटे समूह में ‘पिटारा’ शब्द की अपनी समझ को व्यक्त किया और उसकी विशेषताओं को इंगित किया कि पिटारा सबके लिए अनोखा कैसे होता है, हम अपने पिटारे में क्या-क्या रखना पसंद करेंगे, जैसे अनुभव | बच्चे अपने पिटारे में क्या रखना पसंद करेंगे या कोई ऐसी चीज़ जो उनके पिटारे में पहले से है, उस पर उन्होंने पहेली बनाई और फिर सब ने मिलकर उन पहेलियों को सुलझाया | जब हम थोड़े से बड़े हो जायेंगे, उस समय हम कुछ न कुछ बनने की इच्छा रखेंगे | इस बात को साझा करने के लिए, विनीता कृष्णा द्वारा – ‘मैं हूँ’ – कविता को पढ़ा गया | इसके बाद बच्चे क्या बनने की इच्छा रखते हैं, वे भी उन्होंने साझा किया | आगे चलकर बच्चों ने अपने खुद के पहचान कार्ड बनाए, जिससे उन्होंने यह बताने का भी प्रयास किया कि वे ऐसे कौन-कौन से काम करते हैं जिनसे उनकी पहचान होती है | आगे चलकर हमने, अपनी पसंद की किताबों के बारे में भी बात की | इसके लिए हमने NCERT द्वारा, कहानी – ‘मेरी किताब’ और प्रथम द्वारा प्रकाशित – ‘चलो ! किताबें खरीदने’ को पढ़ा | कोई भी किताब को हम कैसे चुनते हैं, इस बात पर भी सभी बच्चों ने अपनी राय दी | बच्चे समूह में अपनी मनपसंद किताब ले कर आए थे और उन्होंने उसके बारे में भी अपने दोस्तों को बताया भी व उसके बारे में लिखा | गर्मी की छुट्टियों में, इस गतिविधि के अगले भाग में, बच्चों को अपनी खुद से कहानियों व कविताओं की रचना करने को दिया जाएगा | Recording of measurements by children and their parents In Math, we commenced with the concept of measurement where children explored the length of their body parts, say arm, leg, etc by first estimating and then measuring it through non-standard units such as jodo blocks and rangometry tiles. We involved parents in concept formation where both the children and the parents measured similar objects via foot span and handspan. Through the discussions, we understood that the size of the hand and foot varies from person to person. Hence, it is necessary to use a uniform, non-standard unit to measure things like A4 size sheets, unsharpened pencils, etc else, the measurement will differ from person to person. Through the poem ‘‘छोटी का कमाल’ and the story ‘Just a Little Bit’ they gained an understanding that the seesaw can be balanced through the weight put on it and not the number of things. A Self-portrait showing the things the child likes doing As children were exploring self in Project. In Art, we took the opportunity to go one step further. Learners observed themselves in a mirror, drew and coloured their own self- portraits. Further, we worked on the diversity in skin colours through a story: ‘Colours of Us’ and celebrated all the skin colours. They also created self-puppets and painted them in the shade of brown by choosing a brown shade that matches with their favourite brown food. It could be anything from brownies to chocolates to potatoes and breads. In this process, they learnt to make different shades of brown by mixing red, yellow and blue. Colours of Us : Self – puppets The most interesting part of the project was the reflective exercises and the Buddy Program. It was mesmerising to see them engaging in the project enthusiastically. The Buddy Program was another striking feature of our project. The goal of connecting more with their own selves, their family members and friends was achieved to a great extent. Children’s learning : The children delved deeper into observing themselves and reflecting on their actions more. Each one of them reflected back and could clearly observe their growing selves and the new things they are exploring/learning each day. Facilitators’ learning : As facilitators of the group, we learnt that the near to far approach for children’s learning is the best approach. It builds some familiarity and relatability for children. Talking about their home, family members and friends allows them to see themselves in relation with other people and things. Why we chose that theme : It was a great opportunity to do this project during the lockdown period as the children were able to connect more and develop a bond with themselves, their family members, friends and their physical space. v Reflections from our Merry Group (Grade 1) The first part of the project, Children also made their own life-sized body cutouts on chart paper and themselves decided what all fine details to be added so that the cutout looks exactly like them. They also labelled the body parts therein which was a treat to watch! “Me”, focussed on exploring and familiarising the children with their body parts through dance and games such as “hara samundar gopi chander” and “Move your body parts if you like…..”. Learners were also familiarised with the names of the body parts in both Hindi and English languages. They were also given the opportunity to explore their body movements by moving their different body parts in different directions. To refine their knowledge of the five senses, they played different games around the senses. Various sensory experiences were given such as closing their eyes and guessing familiar sounds being created such as that flipping the pages of a book or musical instruments, popping a balloon, falling of a coin, on and off sound of the light switch, etc. They were also given the opportunity to observe different sounds in their environment which strengthened their understanding of the senses. We played an observation game to notice changes around. They also observed and drew their favourite thing keeping it in front of them. These activities gave learners an insight into how important their senses are. In English sessions, children saw themselves in the mirror and shared one positive aspect of themselves by saying “I see a girl/boy who…” Through this activity, they looked deep into themselves to find a positive aspect about themselves. They also made stick puppets of themselves based on the poem ‘The Mirror’. Stories like “The bear who shared” gave us the opportunity to work with our learners to facilitate them in exploring their senses. Also through the story “Colors on the street” learners were able to work on listening where they had to listen to the instructions and do the task. Through these stories vocabulary for different tastes was also reinforced. In Math, children strengthened their understanding of shapes and identified various shapes in different body parts. “The Shape of Me and Other Stuff” is a simple text that helped our children think about the shape of things they usually neglect. This book also encourages children to be proud of their unique shape, as it concludes with, “Hooray for the shapes in which we are in! With the help of the story and their experiences, children learnt to describe both regular and irregular shapes. This book also conveys a clear message that being different is a good thing. Different is a positive message and one we need to be reminded of in the present circumstances. With Art, we took the learning forward and explored diversity and uniqueness in different skin colours. Children made their puppets and painted them in different shades of brown. To add more fun to the activity, they were told to choose the shade of brown that matches the brown shade of their favourite food item! In this process, they also learn to make brown shades by mixing Red, Yellow, and Blue. किसी भी चीज़ की पहचान हमारे मनपसंद काम से होती हैतो हमने हिंदी में शुरुआत भी एक खेल के साथ की | सभी ने समूह में मिलकर छुपन-छुपाई का खेल खेला और साथ ही साथ इस खेल से जुड़ी एक कहानी भी सुनी ’छुपन-छुपाई’- बरखा सीरीज़ | बच्चों ने लिखकर एवं चित्रों द्वाराअपने घर में छिपने की अलग-अलग जगहों के बारे में भी इस बात को बताया – दोस्त भी हमारे परिवार का एक हिस्सा होते हैं और दोस्ती को समझने के लिए हमने “नन्हें चूज़े की दोस्त” – एकलव्य द्वारा प्रकाशित कहानी को भी बच्चों के साथ साझा किया | कहानी को सुनते समय बच्चों को उसका शीर्षक नहीं बताया गया था जो कि उन्हें खुद बनाना था | बच्चों ने जो शीर्षक बनाए वे कुछ इस प्रकार थे – “बिल्ली मौसी दोस्तों की प्यारी”, “बिल्ली और उसके सारे दोस्त”, “बिल्ली और चूज़े की दोस्ती” आदि | कहानी के बाद अगले चरण में, बच्चों के कौन-कौन दोस्त हैं? उन्होंने उसके बारे में भी हमें बताया | जब हमने बच्चों के साथ उनके घर के बारे में बात की तब हमने इसकी शुरुआत “आओ तुम्हें दिखलाता हूँ एक जगह मैं ऐसी” कविता से की और साथ ही साथ प्रथम द्वारा प्रकाशित “मेरा घर” कहानी भी पढ़ी | यहाँ पर जब हम घर की बात कर रहे थे, तब बच्चों ने अपने घर में उपस्थित तरह-तरह की चीज़ों को पहचाना और वे कहाँ पर रखी जाती हैं उनकी जगह का भी अवलोकन किया | साथ ही साथ बच्चों ने इस बारे में भी बताया कि वे अपने परिवार के साथ क्या-क्या करना पसंद करते हैं| नीचे दिए गए कुछ चित्रों की तरह – अपने शरीर के अंगों को पहचानने के लिए और उन अंगों की क्रियाओं को समझने के लिए बच्चों के साथ – “एक में दो” – गुलज़ार द्वारा, कविता की गई, साथ ही साथ कविता के बाद अपने विचारों को और मज़बूत बनाने के लिए अन्य गतिविधियों का भी सहारा लिया गया था | “कुछ सीधा कुछ घुंघराला” – प्रथम द्वारा प्रकाशित, कहानी को भी इसी थीम में जोड़ा गया था | बच्चों ने अपने शरीर के उन अंगों को पहचाना जो गिनती में दो हैं और ऐसे भी अंग जो एक हैं | नीचे दिए गए कुछ चित्रों की तरह – अपनी इंद्रियों की क्रिया को पहचानने के लिए – यहाँ आँख – हम सभी ने मिलकर एक कहानी के द्वारा किया, जिसका नाम था “ठीक से देखो” – एकलव्य द्वारा प्रकाशित | इस कहानी के हर पन्ने में हमने कुछ बारीक चीज़ों को ढूंढने का प्रयास किया था – जैसी कि – झाड़ में तितली, गठरी में नानी की साड़ी, छोटे से पौधे पर बड़ा सा फल आदि | इसके बाद बच्चों को कहा गया था कि उन्हें अपने घर में लगी कोई एक तस्वीर को ठीक से देखना है और ऐसी चीज़ को पहचानना है जिस पर उनकी पहले कभी नज़र नहीं गई | बच्चों ने कुछ मज़ेदार चीज़ों का अवलोकन किया और सबके साथ साझा भी किया – जैसे – एक बच्चे का कहना था कि जब उन्होंने अपने भाई के साथ उनकी बचपन की तस्वीर को ठीक से देखा तो उन्हें दिखाई दिया कि उनके भाई ने मुट्ठी बंद की हुई है | एक बच्चे ने कहा कि उन्होंने अपने पापा और उनके दोस्तों की तस्वीर को ध्यान से देखने के बाद अपने पापा को पहचाना और साथ ही साथ यह भी देखा कि फोटो के पीछे पेड़-पौधे भी लगे हुए हैं | इस क्रिया को और मज़बूत बनाने के लिए बच्चों को चित्र दिखाए गए थे जिनमें उन्हें 5 अंतर को खोजना था | बच्चों ने अपनी मौखिक भाषा का इस्तमाल करते हुए इस क्रिया को किया | During the summer break, Merry group will be closely associated with the tasks related to their emotions, family, and home. They are given stories like “The Way I Feel” and “अक्कू हुई गुस्सा” that are related to emotions which will help them to express their emotions using appropriate vocabulary. To be able to connect more with their family members, learners are given the opportunity to create a book “मेरा परिवार” where they will draw and write a few lines about their respective family member and the family members will also write a few lines about the child. To build a connection with their home, learners are given the opportunity to draw themselves sitting in their favourite corner of the home and write a few lines about their home. They are also encouraged to create their house models where they can use materials of their choice to build their houses. Children’s learning : During this journey to understand the self better, the children took a deeper look into themselves, commenced their journey to understand and start appreciating diversity all around them. Facilitator’s learning : While working with our learners, we, as facilitators realized that learners have a lot of knowledge and their ways to express that knowledge, therefore we should give them ample opportunities so that they can come out with their experiences and thoughts, and opinions Why we chose that theme : We, as facilitators felt that before exploring and making meaning of various things in their environment, they should first explore and understand themselves, their bodies, and their immediate environment i.e. family and home. And it was a great opportunity to do this project during the lockdown period as the children were able to connect more and develop a bond with their family members and their physical space.

Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts. Click here to read more about MannanA Campus Enriched by Nature's BountyOur landscape is a vibrant testament to our commitment to biodiversity and natural beauty. Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious",

Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy.

Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts. Click here to read more about MannanA Campus Enriched by Nature's BountyOur landscape is a vibrant testament to our commitment to biodiversity and natural beauty. Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious",

    "title": "The Ancient Indian Empires Project (Grade 7) - Prakriti",
    "description": "",
    "main_content": "The Ancient Indian Empires Project (Grade 7) by Prakriti | Dec 11, 2020 When we began this project, there were three questions in our minds. Why don’t Indians question what is written about their culture and history in books with what they see around them? Why are they not proud of their own heritage? Why do they not have heroes in their history that they talk about as “Cool” or want to buy merchandise on or even get cool quotes from? At another level, the effort was to make History engaging so that the learners are able to dive deep into it on their own, in future. The questions here were: How do we get them excited about the historical evidence in our country where there is so much more to explore? How do we get them to learn to understand the vocabulary used in History but also get them to express it in their own language? (Usually History is tough in school because the vocabulary used there is not the English they are used to and so they learn to cram “Key Words”). How do we get them to refer multiple sources and cross verify facts? Can we get them to open up their minds and ask questions? Can we get them to write about two thousand words? We had discussions among the three of us. For two of us, history is a subject we ourselves are exploring. One of us has studied history but not taught it in this manner. So this was uncharted waters even for us. We did not know how much material was available and which child required what kind of help. But we were clear that each child would need individual attention. And what a journey it has been! We have been co-learning with the children. Each child brought out that aspect of the empire that they were most excited about. Not only did most of them write 1500 words or more over a period of a couple of weeks, but also wrote a poem or picked a story about that king and presented it to the whole school. With each child, we discovered unique strengths and we had to figure a way of collaborating. The First Indian Empire (Mauryan) The first empire we worked on was the Mauryan Empire. Jahnavi, a home-schooler who has chosen to do History with us, was an avid reader and had already read a lot about the empire. She had written extensively by herself. For us this was an indicator on how this whole project could go. So we had a lot of discussions and arguments between ourselves. She co-presented this project with a facilitator. After the presentation, we took cues from her writing and helped her organise her writing. We found what had fascinated her about this empire was how they managed to administer this empire so efficiently! She was amazed that they had even conducted what was possibly India’s first census. So we read the Arthashastra carefully and Jahnavi read a part of it too. What a find it was to see how advanced and liberal a book on economics and statecraft written 2500 years ago could be! As part of this project, we also talked about higher education in India in Universities like Takshila. How so many years ago students from all over the world came to India to study. How the university and a guru had transformed a goat herd into a king. Writing the first research paper, without any precedence from the peers, was obviously fraught with challenges for Jahnavi. Somehow in the hierarchy of things we think correct spelling comes before clarity of thought or research and writing. Our learning here was that each learner is progressing based on what he or she is paying attention to at that moment. A child who was reluctant to hand in any written assignments had turned in a 22-page paper. Also see her exploration on a journey and the description of it. Masters of the Silk Route (Kushan Empire) The next project on the Kushan Empire was done by Aadiya. We leveraged technology extensively. The facilitator and the learner read several papers together sharing the screen. The learner was reluctant to read by herself but could very easily comprehend what she was asked to read and express it in much simpler language, precisely. We learnt to look at multiple sources and reconcile conflicting data. We spent so much time that her mother complained! When a coin, an inscription or a place was mentioned, we looked up that again. Aadiya was very excited by the documentaries on the silk route. We as facilitators did not know that there was so much material available on Kanishka or how big a role India played in the silk route trade. The pictures of silk route treasures that we found, images of the gold coins issued, pictures of sculptures and art of this period and the traces of Buddhist monasteries along with the maps of the silk route made this presentation a visual treat. The learner presented it by herself very confidently and later even wrote a poem on King Kanishka and that is when we really understood how much she had absorbed! Read her paper on the empire and watch her recite her poem on the emperor Kanishka. Mauryan’s Native Successors (Satavahanas) Avni worked on the Satavahanas. She was keener to present rather than to research. What she was reading and writing was compartmentalised, but when she had written the whole thing, she was able to see the whole picture quite well. She was amazed at what she herself had done and felt like she was graduating. “I have written so well!” she exclaimed. For her facilitator, this was high because being able to see a learner to appreciate her own success means that we are on the way to creating a self-driven learner. Avni was also quite excited that Gautamiputra Satkarni had taken on his mother’s name. She was very excited about this empire’s connection to the Mauryan trade route and even titled her paper thus. It was nice to see that she felt that sense of continuation. She was also curious about why the Satavahanas were called that? Read her paper and watch her recite her poem on Gautamiputra as his court poet. The Golden Age (The Gupta Empire) We as facilitators were very excited about the Gupta Empire. However, initially we could not get Ivaan to get interested. We had a difficult time and discussed what to do when an otherwise engaged child is not involved. Should we let it be? But that is an important period and peer learning was involved. Seeing his peers having fun with their research, his mentor’s nudge and parents’ encouragement swung the tide in our favour and Ivaan was ready sooner than we thought. Ivaan turned in a comprehensive project – too comprehensive for it to be feasible to do in two weeks! We had hoped that he would get excited by the brave rulers of the empire and astronomy, mathematics and medicine and delve deeper into that. But that did not happen. We just had to step back and let him present. Ivaan’s presentation began in a monotone, predictably. But as children started asking questions, Ivaan held his own and explained in his own words. He was able to think, reason and answer. Even though he hadn’t written much on the rulers or sciences he was able to recall his readings and think on his feet. What made the presentation lively for other learners was a quiz that he had made. That got all other children involved and it became a standard that they adopted and everyone built in a quiz at the end of their presentations. So sometimes the learning is not in the area that we want but there is learning nevertheless. What we noticed is a gradual change in Ivaan as the presentations progressed. He is actually excited about India’s history in the final assessment. In his words, “I got to know how India was a rich and advanced country. I also got to know India was beautiful and created things used in the modern world”. Read his paper and listen to his story on Vikramaditya and Betaal. A Righteous Emperor (The Vardhana Empire) Shiv Mittal did his project on Harshavardhana. He was so sincere that he and the facilitator, read several papers on the dynasty and the king thoroughly not sparing a single line or nuance – this, everyday over two weeks. Shiv would read a sentence and stop at every word that he did not understand and discuss the word and the line carefully. We must have read over seven different research papers and also looked for maps and other evidence mentioned in each paper. He also wrote each idea in his own words and checked back to see if he had captured it right. To Shiv, Harsha was a role model because at just sixteen he faced a lot of difficulties but yet took on the challenges. We were also able to capture many nuances of how the society changed during this empire because we read so carefully. For example the king began giving land grants to people with the agricultural workers and a feudal system set in. Read his paper and watch him recite his poem here as Banabhatta. The Sea-faring Kings (Chola Empire) The fourth project was on the Cholas! We expected this to be tough for Ved had declared at the outset that he could not write. But what we discovered was quite the opposite. He would schedule his meetings, ask for pointed help, and read and write by himself with ease but he needed a facilitator to chat to at the other end. He was so excited by the Naval expeditions and the ships of the Cholas that he declared that he would make Lego models! He kept track of all the source links and mentioned them meticulously at the end of his paper. He was also quite excited about being “Co-facilitator” and was at ease in the role. At the end, he thanked Raja Raja Chola and Rajendra Chola for being such cool guys because of whom he had had so much fun. His excitement was infectious and caused the lone historian among the facilitators to remark “You have inspired me to learn more about the empire!”. Read his paper and listen to his story on Rajendra Chola’s naval warfare in SE Asia. Now Forgotten Empire (Karkotas) Aditya who worked on the Karkota Empire and their prominent king Lalitaditya Mukhtapida was the most reluctant. He did not want to take up an obscure empire. He wanted to work on the Mauryas! But that was taken. But as he started working on it, he got excited, in fact very motivated. Aadiya, his twin who is also in the class mentioned to us that he would pipe up every now and then at home about what Lalitaditya had done. He mentioned in his presentation that he felt let down that so little was known about this huge empire which was at least three times the size of the Mughal Empire at its peak. We realise how much sensitivity we build in children when we read History in a way that they can connect. Lalitaditya built the Martand Sun temple in Kashmir which is now in ruins. Aaditya was upset that Bollywood had used the place for a film rather casually. Aditya was so excited about Lalitaditya that he composed a poem about him with his mother’s help, dressed up as Kalhana, the poet who wrote Rajatarangini, Kashmir’s history in verse and recited the poem with a lot of emotion. Paper that Aditya presented and the poem he recited convey his keen interest and awe with the valour of Lalitaditya. The Inclusive Rulers (Rashtrakutas) For Madhav and his mother, this project was an occasion to bond! And he mentioned during his presentation that he liked working on it but his mom was excited about each detail they discovered together. In fact, he has written that he liked to see his mom having fun. They have spent a lot of time together because it is a comprehensive project with a lot of details and pictures. This was heart warming for us because we as facilitators feeling learning should be joyous. Long afterwards, this is the memory that stays and becomes an attitude. Madhav was very tentative about his presentation but he did hold forth quite well even though there were a lot of questions and cross talking during his presentation. We had not worked with him closely but we got our feedback in the final assessment paper. This is what he had written: “Yes I did enjoy learning about ancient empires. I understood a lot about ancient empires. Here is what I learned: Map of Bharat kept changing with different empires until our current map. People focused on education back then. They built their first ever university called Taxila University. There were different scholars and advisors like Amoghavarsha, Aryabhatta, Sri ponna and Chanakya. There were 3 religions that were popular back then these religions were Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and each empire built many temples on it. Languages that have been popular were Sanskrit and Prakrit. India has been the land of science and literature.” Read his paper and watch him recite his poem. The Art Loving Rulers (Pallavas) Jaiditya presented on Pallavas and culminated the discussion with a culturally mighty South Indian empire. He had finished his research long back with the help of his parents at home and was confident about it. He presented well with Dolly didi’s help. His research paper was well-worded and he related to the story of the Ashwamedha Yagna performed by Mahendra Varma with the incident he knows about. Never Say Die (Chalukyan Rulers) Our second last presentation was on the Chalukyas by Sakshi. The facilitator gave her some papers and she read them and wrote her paper in her own words. She had structured the long paper herself. She was very keen about art, architecture, coins and evidence and looked up a variety of resources. She shared many of those images of temples and coins with us. She was nervous about her presentation but she pushed herself and presented a visual-rich paper. In closing At the end of the project, we facilitators are quite satisfied. We had got each child to read, write, present, listen to other children and ask questions and then write a poem! A long journey! More importantly we felt that we had managed to instil a sense of India’s rich and long history. A few days later, to a question on what they learned about India’s heritage, we were pleasantly surprised to see the responses ranging from Indian Mathematics to medicine to Sanskrit to temple architecture to Kalidasa’s poetry! With warm regards, Dolly Sharma, Vidya Viswanathan and Rahul Batra\n\n\n\n--- Substack Article ---\nCan We Save the Planet or Should We Save Ourselves? Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources.

    "main_content": "Prakriti celebrates its 9th birthday… by Prakriti | May 4, 2020 Prakriti celebrated its 9th birthday through a collective rendition of its anthem song, ek chiri sureeli si, by its diyas (our facilitators), singing from remote locations during lockdown. They greeted the children in this morning with this song that surely amazed them with familiar voices of their didi-bhaiyas. The children responded with prolific art works and recorded their wishes throughout the day.\n\n\n\n--- Substack Article ---\nCan We Save the Planet or Should We Save Ourselves? Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts. Click here to read more about MannanA Campus Enriched by Nature's BountyOur landscape is a vibrant testament to our commitment to biodiversity and natural beauty. Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious",

    "main_content": "Frequently Asked Questions How do we co-create knowledge How do you deliver experiential or deep learning? Sri Aurobindo had said, “nothing can be taught, it can only be learnt” and “learning goes from near to far”. Our education model revolves around facilitation and NOT teaching. Facilitation is a collaborative process where the teacher works together with the learners on developing experiences and curating resources so that the child is able to stretch beyond what he/she already knows to the zone of deep learning. Our facilitators are continuously researching and learning new ideas, teaching technologies as well as pedagogies. Examples of projects in Grade 4 can be found here. Some other key aspects of the learning programme at Prakriti are Connect with Nature and Socio-Emotional Learning. How do you impart Socio-Emotional Learning? From early years, we work on listening to ourselves, our inner being, as a habit. The learners have a circle time with the facilitators to talk freely about themselves, their peers as well as their immediate environment. Processes like developing rules for the classroom democratically, naming their group at the beginning of the year themselves are some of the ways through which we cultivate self-management and inner discipline. Prakriti children engage a lot in reflective writing and drawing to express their feelings. Older children meet with their facilitators in one-one sessions to express themselves openly and receive what their “didis” have to say. The school also provides proactive counselling to adolescents and parents. Does the experiential learning methodology work in middle and senior grades? Absolutely. Experiential learning happens in a variety of forms. If it is by visualising, contextualising, touching, feeling and observing in early years, it is through enacting, reading stories in-context, going to factories and museums for enquiry and researching the topics for deep-learning. We have maker- and tinkering-labs for science experiments and creative modelling. Languages are taught in an inter-disciplinary way combining visual arts, theatre and literature. The approach works very well for deep learning in middle school. Cambridge (IGCSE) subjects lend themselves to enquiry and group projects in high school. What is the language of instruction and communication in school, especially in the early years? Does learning English late hamper their ability to interact in English? Prakriti is a bilingual school with English and Hindi as language of instruction in the early years. We start teaching Hindi formally in ages 3 and 4 and move to English reading and writing by age 4.5. Children who have a good command of the mother tongue are found to pick up multiple languages easily. In our experience, Prakriti learners are proficient in both English and Hindi, reading, writing and speaking, by the time they are 7, i.e, in Grade II. How many students are there per facilitator? There are around 12-15 learners per facilitator, which is a very healthy ratio. In early years (K-2), the learner-facilitator ratio is 7:1. We strongly believe in addressing the learning needs of each learner based on their interests, cultural background and prior knowledge. With a small class size, we are able to work on creating learning programmes that work for each child. How do you ensure one-on-one attention is being given to each student? We work with learners individually, in small groups. We develop learning goals (which includes, physical, emotional, core subjects and arts) for each child and work through the year in collaboration with the parents to track progress and reinforce learning at school and home. We have a practice of “bubble time” where a child can speak to the facilitator freely and vice-versa. We meet with each parent/family individually at least twice in a year over detailed meetings with all subject facilitators to discuss the observations about each learner. Low student ratio per class does give individual attention but does it promote healthy competition? Competition is usually within your own self; this requires the art and skill of deep self-reflection, a life skill that we develop in learners at Prakriti.. Competition with self and cooperation with others is the essence for bringing out the best in a child. We prepare our kids to face the real world. How do Prakriti children fare in comparison with children from other schools? Learner-centered systems of education do not focus on competing with the peers or standardised metrics. Yet, as we follow the goals laid down by National Curriculum Framework in India (NCERT) and Cambridge International, our children are at the similar learning levels as their peers in other schools. They get there joyfully. Affiliation and Prospects after School Does Prakriti have any affiliation? We are affiliated to Cambridge Assessment International Education (CAIE). It is also known as International General Certificate for Secondary Education (IGCSE). We follow the learning outcomes defined by Cambridge while also meeting the goals set by National Curriculum Framework (NCF) in India. What is IGCSE or Cambridge affiliation? Over 10,000 schools in over 160 countries around the world offer Cambridge qualifications. CAIE is a division of Cambridge Assessment, a not-for-profit organisation and part of the world renowned University of Cambridge. Cambridge IGCSE is the world’s most popular international qualification for 14 to 16 year olds. It is taken in over 150 countries and in more than 4800 schools around the world. In India, here are about 400 schools that are affiliated with Cambridge. Why has Prakriti chosen Cambridge affiliation? We have chosen Cambridge over other boards because it offers freedom to learn in the way learners and teachers define together as the best way to learn rather than teaching to test. The learning outcomes defined by Cambridge are very well aligned with 21st Century skills for the learners- Critical Thinking, Communication, Collaboration and Creativity. Which degree/certificate will the children have in Class 12? We will offer International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP), offered by IB, Geneva. IBDP is the most popular high school degree programme. Is Cambridge/IBDP acceptable by Indian Universities? Yes. Most public and private universities accept Cambrirdge and IBDP certificates. In fact, Association of Indian Universities, https://www.aiu.ac.in/, set up by the UGC Act provides an equivalent certificate for use by national universities, if the child has an international degree or diploma such as IGCSE A Levels or IBDP. What are the prospects after Grade 12 for an International Certificate? A child from Prakriti would integrate into any other school as easily as they would from any other school. There have been some children who have needed to move out from Grades 1-5 and have adjusted well at other mainstream schools. Grade 10 and 12 students will have internationally and nationally recognized degree certificates to be accepted in any system. What are the prospects after Prakriti, if a child is leaving before Grade 10? Do you find any gaps in Prakriti children’s learning? Our curriculum is aligned with the Cambridge curriculum as well as with the National Curriculum Framework set by NCERT so that the learners are achieving the baseline learning outcomes expected of them, when they move schools. In the past, the children who have moved out of Prakriti, have adjusted well in the mainstream schools. Measures of learning outcomes testing such as ASSET have reported above-average learning levels for most of our learners. See what parents say about this here: Subjects and Learning Disciplines How do you assess academic skills? We begin formal graded examinations in Grade 9. Before that in Grades 6-8 we assess learners in a system of formative (feedback to the teacher) and summative (feedback to the learners) tests. Both of these tests are informal and are conducted within the regular school. We also assess children on aptitude in various subjects using a standardised test called ASSET, administered over 4,00,000 children across private and public schools in India. Would it be relevant to mention the ATS also here – its at a national level, and gives exposure to the children of an external examination set-up? We observe children round the year on socio-emotional skills, physical ability, learning styles and habits. Our annual report is quite rigorous and comprehensive where we include a child’s learning on holistics learning: emotional well-being social learning physical stamina and strength cognitive ability subject-specific learning, expression and learning styles We set the learning goals with the participation of the parents and maintain a living document that can be referenced for measuring progress. The year-end reports also present a plan for parents and teachers to work together to address the gaps and hone the strengths. How do Prakriti children fare in comparison with children from other schools? Learner-centered systems of education do not focus on competing with the peers or standardised metrics. Yet, as we follow the goals laid down by National Curriculum Framework in India (NCERT) and Cambridge International, our children are at the similar learning levels as their peers in other schools. They get there joyfully. How do children learn arts and music in Prakriti? We have an all-year programme on Arts with quarterly modules on Theatre, Visual Arts, Music (vocals and instrumental) and Dance. All learners go through all the modules until they begin to specialise by Grade 8. Our Arts facilitators are highly qualified and specialised. For presentations, both in-school and external, a lot of times the children take the lead in planning and executing the program – they ideate, write, compose, edit – with the facilitators giving them ample support and direction, as required. What do children learn in primary school? Besides the key languages and Math, they learn Sanskrit (Grade 4 and above), Music (vocal and instrumental), Art, Technology, Swimming and Gymnastics as core disciplines. What do children learn in middle school? Besides the key languages and Math, they learn French (Grade 7 and above), Music (vocal and instrumental), Theatre, Art & Design, Technology, Natural Science and Indian & Global Studies as core disciplines. What do children learn in high school? We offer the following Cambridge courses: English Language & Literature, World Literature, Hindi or French, Mathematics (Core & Extended), Coordinated Sciences, Global Perspectives, Enterprise, Art & Design and Design & Technology. A learner must take 7 subjects including English, Math and Second Language to qualify for ICE award. Teachers and Infrastructure What kind of teachers do you hire? We hire multi-discipline qualified teachers with learner-empathy, research-orientation and respectful communication as the most important skill sets over experience or academic background. All teachers, cleaning and security staff are called didi-bhaiya to develop familial affinity with the children and to signal lack of special status to any profession. In middle school, our facilitator pool has significant non-teaching experience to offer diversity and real-world experience. Our current classrooms have a biochemist teaching Natural Sciences, a Hindi Theatre artist and language expert teaching Hindi and an English litterateur and Pali language scholar teaching English. In primary and early years programmes, our teachers have progressive education gathered within Prakriti or schools like Mirambika/Azim Premji University. Freshers from B.El.Ed. programme of Delhi University join us every year and undergo a year of on the job training. How do you motivate and retain your teachers? We build a culture of respectful communication, personal and professional growth for our facilitators. In a joyful, small-classroom learning environment with experiential curriculum, facilitators teach and learn as well. We mentor our facilitators continuously in a structure of professional mentors/researchers assisting the teachers with planning, delivering and assessing the learning outcomes. Founders of the school are directly involved with mentoring the teachers themselves. What facilities do you have for sports? We have dedicated sports time every day for all classes. We emphasize on physical stamina and strength building through gymnastics, cycling and swimming for all ages. We have facilities for basketball, badminton, skateboarding, volleyball, table tennis, squash and football on campus. Learners with Special Needs How do you support learners with special needs? We have a well-established “Bridge” programme with a team of 45 special educators who work with learners with various physical and learning disabilities and special needs. Our counsellors are trained in identifying these needs and working with parents and facilitators to develop modifications and accommodations in curriculum and assessments. We create Individual Education Plans (IEPs) in the beginning of the year in collaboration with the special educators and the parents. We have special educators who work with specific needs such as ADHD, ASD, Dyslexia/Dyscalculia and emotional needs such as anxiety disorders. Does integration of special needs children in classes not create a bias in the minds of “normal” children? Does it not get disruptive? No. We integrate a small number in every class. Typically, the mild learning disabilities are supported by the teachers in the classroom through modifications and accommodations for such learners. Severe disabilities are handled by shadow facilitators who are always present with the children in the classroom. We reinforce our culture of appreciating differences and valuing classroom equity throughout the year. We find that the students’ own learning and their world-view changes in a diverse classroom. Home School Support What is the Home School Support Programme of Prakriti? The learning of Home School learners is no different from the regular Prakriti school learners. They attend all the classes, submit assignments to receive feedback and participate in all school activities such as theatre or music. Thus, the programme is active engagement and not a self-learning schedule. Who is this programme relevant for? We understand that some families who are home-schooling their children need support with the curriculum structure, validation of learning and more importantly peer learning opportunities. Equally, we come across families who have not experienced a progressive system of education from regions far from the school. That’s why we started the Home School Support Programme last year. We have accommodated 2-3 “home learners” in our classrooms. Does a learner need to opt for all the subjects taught by the School? No. We have created two baskets of subjects: Lite and Full. Under Lite Support, the learner will attend classes in English, Math, Technology, Science & Social Sciences (5 subjects). Under Full Support, the learner will also attend Second Language, Art and Music classes (8 courses). How is assessment done? As with regular school, home learners will participate in Formative and Summative Assessments, ASSET Diagnostics and Benchmarking Tests as well as Presentation of Learning. The report provided at the end of the year is largely qualitative except in Grade 8 onwards where grades are ascribed as well. Will the Home Learner be enrolled as a private candidate for IGCSE? It is the choice of the family. Any learner who completes both Grade 9 and 10 with us will be offered the regular school status for the IGCSE. What will happen when Prakriti moves to being a Physical School post-Covid? Home School learners will continue to receive the lessons in either hybrid classroom or in small group sessions with the teachers. Our Environment With a restriction on student size how does it become feasible for a school to sustain itself? Deep learning cannot be facilitated in crowded classrooms. Having said that every school needs to sustain itself. We keep our overheads low and focus on having classrooms with very highly skilled facilitators. We have grown in the last nine years, organically, to be a K-12 school now. We are not focused on excess profits/surplus. How do you pitch yourself against more aggressive institutional power? We have not felt the need to pitch ourselves against institutional establishments. Our community, of parents and learners, is our biggest ambassador and it is the reason we have grown organically over the past three years. We are a self-funded organisation and thus not answerable to outside investors. You have a fee structure comparable to established schools with various facilities. How do you justify it? We do not have any hidden charges for uniform, stationery, computers, projects etc. We are an Cambridge International school and have to uphold academic standards with rigour. We feel that our fee structure is well-justified by the low student to facilitator ratio and compassionate facilitators who are working with an individualised facilitation approach not didactic teaching. Prakriti is a green campus and ensures a healthy and natural environment, several field and farm trips in a year. We work not only with the children but also the parents with several group meetings with whole classroom parents, discussing the goals and learning approaches. All these features are part of Prakriti fee. Why don’t you believe in school uniforms? Does it not lead to differentiation in classrooms? Uniforms are required in industrial set-ups. Learners extend home learning to school when the enabling environment is kept the same. A school uniform also adds an extra and unnecessary financial burden on a family. We ensure that children wear normal and comfortable clothes and it doesn’t lead to differentiation. We discuss with the families wherever there is a deviation from this norm. Do you encourage competition? We encourage learners to compete with themselves. Each child participates in sports day and gets a medal, there are no differentiated medals. Formal grades are not awarded until Grade 9. We do not publish results of assessments to a group (or class). Individual reports are kept confidential and discussed only with the parents.

Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts. Click here to read more about MannanA Campus Enriched by Nature's BountyOur landscape is a vibrant testament to our commitment to biodiversity and natural beauty. Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious",

AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts. Click here to read more about MannanA Campus Enriched by Nature's BountyOur landscape is a vibrant testament to our commitment to biodiversity and natural beauty. Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious",

Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits.

    "main_content": "by Prakriti | Jan 11, 2023 Hocokah: A Socratic Dialogue On 20th December, Prakriti organized the first edition of ‘Hocokah – A Socratic Dialogue’ on the theme of ‘Learning in Relationship’. This was a speaking-listening event with an intent to initiate dialogue among students and to bring into focus the qualities of ‘listening’ and ‘working together’. It spanned 45 days with three 15 day slots. Every fortnight the participants received a batch of articles on philosophy, scientific research and reportage which they were expected to read and then respond to questions on a special Google Classroom created for the purpose. The articles ranged from relationships with the digital world, to education and interpersonal relationships. After the last fortnight, they came to Prakriti on the 20th. At Prakriti they were seated in a circle and the following challenge statement was given to them to decipher and understand. “A human being, is a mass of accumulated knowledge and reactions according to that knowledge. Computers and Artificial Intelligence are taking charge of all that. It is happening. Now, the brain is being exercised through pain, through pleasure, through suffering, anxiety, all the rest of it. But it is working. And when the computers and AI take over, it will cease to work. And if it is not working, it will deteriorate; it is because we have problems, it acts.” They discussed and debated for close to three hours at the end of which they were expected to present a ‘Document of Understanding’ which reflected the common understanding of the group. However, to exert the participants a bit so as they move beyond their comfort zone of offering opinions and judgments about the statement, certain rules were laid out. These included, they could neither agree or disagree with the statement, they had to listen to each speaker and could not cross-talk and they did not have to propose any solutions to the problem (if at all any) the statement was pointing out. All they had to do was to decode the true meaning of the statement in all its complexity. As the discussions unfolded, the meaning of the statement was revised again and again and previous understandings questioned, challenged, dropped and picked up again. There was lively debate and each participant seemed to be deeply immersed in the process of understanding the statement with others. This state of engagement is what is often recognized as deep thinking or critical thinking or constructive dialogue. It was in this space that it appeared that they were no longer worried about agreeing or disagreeing with each other, but actually engaging with the statement and attempting to understand what it meant. Here are some statements from their final ‘Document of Understanding’ which we felt were very insightful and although seemingly simple, hold deep treasures: “Humans have a desperate, constant need to advance. They have a drive or ambition that Ais cannot quash. The human brain will always look for more problems to solve.” “Humans are more than just reactions and emotions.” “AI is a mass of algorithm, data driven knowledge, and reactions according to that knowledge.” “Humans are dependent on AI to a certain extent, whereas, AI is fully dependent on humans.” “If the human mind is not faced with challenges and situations constantly, it will deteriorate; it is because we want to create and evolve, it acts.” Here are some photographs and videos from the event:\n\n\n\n--- Substack Article ---\nCan We Save the Planet or Should We Save Ourselves?

This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts. Click here to read more about MannanA Campus Enriched by Nature's BountyOur landscape is a vibrant testament to our commitment to biodiversity and natural beauty. Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious",

    "main_content": "A study visit to Red Fort : Grade 9 by Prakriti | Mar 23, 2022 Trip to Red Fort was undertaken this month to understand the siege of 1857 and enable the learners to connect with the theme they are studying currently. Historical trips can make history come alive through an understanding of the art, culture and architecture. It also enables the viewer an insight into geo- politics and other finer details by comparing past to present. It is a whole package to learn new things in various dimensions.Certain topics like oppression ,rebellion, abolition, freedom which cannot solely be explained through words can be experienced through visual creation on site. History is not a monolithic narration of the past, but rather a playground of multiple interpretations and scope for diverse interpretations of the past in light of multiple evidences and sources ranging from literary, architectural and oral histories. This half-day study tour aims to help students engage in thoughtful interpretation of diverse sources to challenge various historical misconceptions. Students are expected to analyze a variety of sources like maps, paintings, contemporary primary sources, artifacts that present alternate voices and perspectives of the past. Some observations & inferences: History is written by the victor and can be challenged Historical events are a result of multiple factors. Historical narratives have led to creation of modern day city landscapes Impact of 1857 on Delhi as a city and British as the new ruling class. Learners also saw the trip from an art and design perspective. There were many different types of architecture with contrasting Indian and British influences. Here are a few glimpses of the day. https://prakriti.edu.in/wp-content/uploads/Trip-to-Red-Fort-_March-20222.mp4\n\n\n\n--- Substack Article ---\nCan We Save the Planet or Should We Save Ourselves? Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system.

By celebrating this virtue, we cherish the values manifested in Lord Krishna, Prophet Muhammad and our brave freedom fighters, several of them unsung heroes. This year, social distancing did not dampen the spirit. Not only did we celebrate the Ganesh Chaturthi, Rakshabandhan, Janmashtami and Independence Day in the zoom rooms where learners regaled one another through their craft, stories and dances. On Rakshabandhan we made laddoos and sang songs, on Janmashtami we prepared shrikhand and danced like little Krishna and on Ganesh Chaturthi we made modaks and listened about the might of Lord Ganesha, our friend. The entire school came together twice in the first ever individual expression of loving kindness in creative ways on a common platform. Our middle scholars sang an originally composed rap song whereas our senior primary learners wrote and recited a poem on loving kindness.

They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community.

    "main_content": "LockDown Times: Bridging the Learning Gaps by Prakriti | Mar 28, 2020 Under the current challenging conditions when services abruptly stopped for our Bridge children the team realized that this could possibly be a prolonged and unpredictable closure. This meant our children programs will stall and fall. Along with this, our parents will not be able to access and sustain behavioural gains and guidance required. In view of the above situation an urgent need to create online support systems was recognised and tireless weekend efforts by the team resulted in the “CRIADIGITAL Program” to be executed across CRIA centres at Shahpur Jat , Gurgaon, Faridabad and the BRIDGE program @ PRAKRITI School. The aim was to Empower and support parents via Providing direct online services to children Parental guidance on programs Behavioral Guidance Webinars This endeavour resulted in Engaging and introducing a new way of interaction. Maintaining gains Moving forward with scientifically well supported guidance Supporting and problem-solving as needed for the whole family of parents,children and their social partners aka therapists. Automated zoom usage and information channels were created overnight and starting on Monday the 23rd April 2020, the 6 session pilots per center transformed into a 100+session support in 5 days. This will bloom into its 300+ sessions and multifold floor hours from the coming week. The extension of curfew on Monday evening for 21 days has further justified the sleepless hours spent on developing the “CRIADIGITAL Program” @ BRIDGE and CRIA centers at shahpurjat, gurgaon and faridabad. This herculean task has minor glitches which are being ironed out gradually. The parents feel supported and therapists are super excited to be back with their children and some children ecstatic to have their besties back in their lives …notwithstanding across the screen !!\n\n\n\n--- Substack Article ---\nCan We Save the Planet or Should We Save Ourselves? Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting.

This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts. Click here to read more about MannanA Campus Enriched by Nature's BountyOur landscape is a vibrant testament to our commitment to biodiversity and natural beauty. Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious",

    "main_content": "Project-based Learning: Turning Personal Passions into Projects by Prakriti | Jul 17, 2021 In the age of the internet and fourth industrial revolution when all information is on open sources, communities and automated platforms, deep learning requires more hands-on work than ever before. It is the time for the schools to up the game from experiential learning or projects to Project-based learning in its true essence. At Prakriti, we have started the practice of Personal Projects for all our grades to elevate the co-creation of knowledge and use personal passions to develop skills for active learning. Project-Based Learning Project-based learning (PBL) is a student-centred pedagogy that involves a dynamic classroom approach in which it is believed that students acquire a deeper knowledge through active exploration of real-world challenges and problems. In the traditional teaching method, projects are assigned to the students at the end of the semester which are largely illustrative or a model of something previously learned. While PBL is essentially research-based and demands investigation, the gathering of information, and integration rather than falling onto the preexisting set of knowledge.By definition, project-based learning entails a pragmatic approach to a real-life situation through a well-thought-out suitable plan specially designed to solve a specific problem. In case it deflects from the expected path, it is analyzed and the individual forges ahead with the revised method. Personal Projects @Prakriti Purpose of a personal project is to build an ecosystem for the child for independent learning. As we know that learning is most joyful when it is aligned with the interests of the child. As adults some of us are clear about our passions today but for some who are not, they are advised to go back to their childhood days and remember and think about what they enjoyed the most. Thus, the purity of childhood is the best time to explore one’s passions. Personal project is also an opportunity for the children to know themselves- to explore what they enjoy doing. For some children it could be furthering what their known interests are and while for others it could be something they are curious about and want to build their knowledge on. Project Discovery The learners have been asked to think of topics or research questions for their personal projects and mentors would facilitate a process of self-discovery by asking them the following fundamental questions. 1. Why is the idea personal to you?The idea should be something that the learner is deeply motivated about. 2. What is the challenge in this idea?The project should be that which requires significant effort in achieving from where the learner is today. It is a stretch goal. 3. How will you go about learning in this project?There should be a plan such as consulting people, reading resources or visiting places for gaining information or learning a skill for mastery. 4. How will you demonstrate your learning?There should be a plan to showcase learning by way of a presentation of learning of a product or a piece of writing say, or even a demonstration of dance where the process of learning can be journaled and presented. Self reflection The ultimate objective of a personal project is to develop meta-cognition skills. The learnersshould be able to reflect their ability to learn independently, managing time, overcoming difficulties and collaborating with the mentor. Samples of Personal Projects Our learners are building “products” or shared knowledge on myriad topics that are all unique, connect with them deeply and useful for the society. Examples are: Developing a website to learn western music composition and instrumental music Writing a drama script from Greek Mythology Profiling the techniques of warfare at Maratha, Mughal and British forces Developing simple robots for helping in daily work Learning to make local food to preserve family heritage Understanding the inspiration of gaming entrepreneurs in Japan…and many more… 'Happy' Played by Madhav Training Lio Creating Robot\n\n\n\n--- Substack Article ---\nCan We Save the Planet or Should We Save Ourselves? Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system.

    "main_content": "What can Modern Schools Learn from Ancient Wisdom? by Prakriti | Aug 7, 2021 “Ancient Indian traditions may say a lot to modern schools. Only if the schools are willing to listen….” Once upon a time, there lived a frog who had spent all his life in a well. One day, another frog from the ocean came to its well. The frog from the well started jumping around from one corner of the well to another, boasting of its vastness. For the ocean frog, the well was a joke compared to the ocean. It irked the well frog and it forced its guest out of the well, forever! This is a story by Swami Ramkrishna Paramhansa. Modern learning is making us the ‘frog from the well’. It proclaims to be ‘open’ and ‘inter-disciplinary’ and yet fears the inclusion of ‘religion’ and ‘philosophy’ which form the core base of learning. Modern learning is ironic. It aims to make changes in a system without understanding it from ‘inside-out’. It will find something and put it to action with no long-term vision. ‘Curiosity makes us grow; eagerness can kill!’. If this is not the case, then why are we tracing our ways back to old times and practices? To name a few – Ayurveda, organic farming, yoga, meditation, and the list can go on. There is not one sphere of life that is not covered in the great Vedas, Upanishads, and Vedanta. That was learning in its true form – OBSERVE, INSTILL, ASSIMILATE, PROCESS, UNDERSTAND and one will LEARN instinctively! Changing education from many foreign invasions, especially by Mughals and Britishers, changed the perception of learning. In ancient India, the ideal of life was spiritualistic. So, the aim was attainment of ‘Brahma’ or self-realization. In ancient Sparta education was socialistic, and not individualistic. It aimed at producing courageous soldiers. The Romans had a materialistic outlook. The Middle Ages saw education as a priestly affair – formal in character and religious in outlook. By the twentieth century, education became industrialized with the purpose of contributing to human welfare and progress. The aftermath of these changes – losing the true meaning of learning. Glimpse into Ancient Wisdom The aim of Vedic education was not merely limited to acquisition of knowledge but “development of character” based on the principles of ‘Dharma’. It involved multidimensional approach —- development of moral conscience, personality (self-esteem, self-confidence, self-restraint and self-respect), civic responsibilities and social values, infusion of spiritual and religious values, ethical training, preserving and diffusing national culture, problem solving techniques with ease and calm mind, sharpening intellect and memory, research and development, management as a science, practical education, and achieving enlightenment. The traditional methods of learning had a holistic approach. They did not categorize everything into boxes of analytical, logical, emotional, social, physical, and psychological. Rather, they treated these as a unit which must function together. Vedic education comprised three processes: Sravana (listen and understand), Manana (reflect), and Nididhyaana (complete comprehension by realization and experience) – simple but effective techniques. It was done under a residential schooling system called ‘Gurukul’ where the guru (teacher who also acted as a father-figure) and his shishyas (students) lived a life of ‘Simple Living and High Thinking’. They studied, and developed holistically and spiritually. Parishads (comparable to modern day universities) such as Takshshila, Nalanda, Kashi, Valabhi, Vikramshila, Kanchi, Odantapuri and Jagaddala, to name a few mammoth institutions, attracted learners from all parts of the globe. Sammelans (gatherings) held discussions and competitions among the most learned scholars in the country. The education of Vedas, Upanishads, and Vedangas was not merely religious. It encompassed a range of subjects —- political science, economics, metallurgy, medicinal science, surgery, space research of planets and galaxies, cosmology, astrology, nuclear physics, energy concepts, thermodynamics, environmental management, phonetics, ritualistic knowledge, grammar, metrics, exegetics (science of interpretation), philosophy, warfare, music, dancing, painting, agriculture, investigation, and many more! Acharya Chanakya in his books Kautilya’s Arthashastra and Chanakya Niti documented political and economic management philosophies and strategies. He brought all the separate kingdoms together in India under a central governance – nation called ‘Aryavartha’. It was the first time in human history to ever see a mention of ‘nation’. For centuries, his strategies have been used worldwide to build a nation with sound economics based on spirituality. A comparable quality of iron used in the Iron Pillar of Delhi can not be replicated by the modern metallurgists. It is the largest hand-forged block of iron from days of yore. The description of advanced scientific techniques in the Vedic literature is far more superior than those of the modern technological world. Seeking answers from Ancient Wisdom In the current global scenario, fear in multiple forms is instilled into our brain. Indiscipline, corruption, crimes, and inhuman behaviour are a product of ‘modified learning in factories called modern schools promoting the rat race to be ahead of others’. The pandemic has questioned the ’modern happiness and understanding’. People are becoming insecure. Paul Bloom, a psychology professor at Yale, explains the rhetoric of white supremacy. He explains their slogan “You will not replace us” as a chant of worried people to people they think are a threat to their status and way of life. An unethical man is as good as dead. And unaware, we have become unethical in our mysterious ways. The answer to all these problems can be traced back to ancient wisdom. Natural Learning Traditional methods believed in the natural and unique rhythm of a child for learning from a ‘mixed age community’ in a conducive environment close to Mother Nature with no predisposition to ‘scientific data’, ‘subjects’ and ‘definitive normalcy’. They allowed freedom and hence, learning was at its best. All the major discoveries and inventions were made because the discoverers and inventors were free — free from the boxes of preconceived notions. The fun of learning lies in being wild and not in being tamed. “Everybody has a sense of music in them but not all of us can play a harp”. The current education system of making everybody learn the same things in the same way, at the same pace, in the adult-directed environment of same-age people with the same objective is ignorant in the first place. Ironic enough, this same ‘ignorant education system’ teaches – “Ignorance kills Learning”. Democratic Learning “A civilization is not built of bricks, steel and machinery, it is built with men, their quality and character.” – Dr. Radhakrishnan Traditional education had realized men as social beings. It emphasized on social duties equally. The shishyas were made aware of their duties outside the walls of Gurukul including the importance of being a good child, spouse, parent and citizen of the nation. They honored the code of all the professions. Equality was fostered by providing the same simple living conditions and everyone doing all the basic chores such as cleaning, cooking, and others. Women during Vedic and Upanishadic age enjoyed equal rights in education as men. They were honored and respected in society. The girls were literate in a variety of subjects – religion, literature, dance, music, and other fine arts. Many ‘Sanhitas’ of Rig Veda were composed by women. There were not just Rishis but Rishikas, and not just Gurus but Gurvis. Experiential and Interest-led Learning “Experience is a hard teacher because she gives the test first, the lesson afterward.” – Swami Vivekananda People are told to learn from their ‘experiences’. In a robotic world of ‘do(s) and don’t(s)’, it becomes hard to truly experience things. In the journey of ‘You should be this’, one loses the fun experience of ‘I could have been this’. Traditional methods focussed majorly on ‘inner experience’ – living experience from inside to unfold the metaphysical truths of nature. Self-experience was considered as true learning. The effectiveness of the methodology can be realized from the attraction of so many quantum physicists from around the world to the Vedas in India – Quantum Physics being one of the highest and most researched fields in Science. One of the brightest minds on Earth to ever live, Albert Einstein, once said “We owe a lot to the Indians, who taught us how to count, without which no worthwhile scientific discovery would have been made”. So how do we bring this Ancient Wisdom into our schools? Modern schools have to bring multiple reforms in their approach to revive learning. They have a broader role in cutting the clutter of packing too many things in a child’s schedule and employing natural, democratic, and experiential and interest-led learning. The Aryasamaj Gurukul, the Sanatan Dharma Rishikula, and the Santiniketan School have stood as prominent examples of modern institutions at successfully attempting a revival of Ancient Wisdom in the present age. Modern schools such as Isha Home School, Rishi Valley, Mirambika and Prakriti have espoused some of the ancient wisdom in the way they teach. Some of the ways of achieving these three major zones of learning, inspired from traditional methodology, are: * The modern infrastructure should be conducive and close to Mother Nature for students to experience mindfulness. The educators must have faith in the child’s natural rhythm. By embracing joy and curiosity, learning will become a life-long process. Encouraging mixed-age learning is important for the overall growth and development of a child. Following Guru-Shishya Parampara will develop a natural feeling of respect for elders and others in the society. Activities, training workshops and other methods can be employed to develop a bond of security and trust between teacher and student. The pressurizing ‘rank-based’ system driven by academic performance must be replaced with a ‘value-based’ system driven by a perfect combination of academics and extracurricular activities to promote the uniqueness of a child and make them better individuals. * Socialization of individuals through education is important for passing down the democratic ideals to the society. The students’ learning must be aimed at contributing to the community. The qualities of scientific temperament of mind, tolerance, brotherhood, cooperation, sympathy, empathy, discipline, standing up for social justice, and discipline must be developed. The schools should provide administrative support and community connections for professional development. This can be achieved through resource allocation and goal-setting with expected outcomes. * The learning must be encouraged through self-experience and an interest-led approach. Rote learning and a rigidly defined-curriculum should be discouraged. Children should be helped to develop the skill of meta-cognition, i.e., “how do they know what they know”. Learning should be inter-disciplinary with art, music, theatre, all integral parts of ancient knowledge in India, should be well-integrated into the learning domains of languages, math, and sciences. At the core, it begins with inculcating love for India’s history and source of knowledge and discoveries to the rest of the world. The Advancement It has been centuries since the Britishers have destroyed our culture and Science. The majority of Indians still see the ‘problems’ in us as a nation which has always stood the test of time. Understanding and learning from ‘Abrahamic Lens’ is not going to help the cause. Unfortunately, modern schools have blindly followed the same path. At this point, it is not likely to completely revert to the traditional age of Vedas, Upanishads and Vedanta. Yet, inculcating the learning, approach, and methods from them into the modern system will aid in getting back on the path to true learning. ‘Religion and God’ should not be seen as abstract anymore, but rather as pure science. We already have a dormant form of everything within us. Take a few steps back and find the ‘lost Science’ preserved in our vibrant and glorious ancient culture. This Science does not ask to cut things to the core to learn. It makes us learn things by building up. It is based upon the philosophy of life. ‘Learning from it will show us the way to life’. “Like fire in a piece of flint, knowledge exists in mind. Suggestion is the friction which brings it out.” – Swami Vivekananda About the author: Shreya is a writing enthusiast and an educator. She holds a Master’s in Biology from University of Delhi.\n\n\n\n--- Substack Article ---\nCan We Save the Planet or Should We Save Ourselves? Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts. Click here to read more about MannanA Campus Enriched by Nature's BountyOur landscape is a vibrant testament to our commitment to biodiversity and natural beauty. Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious",

    "main_content": "Homeschooling in India by Prakriti | Jul 7, 2021 “The home is mankind’s first and most basic school. Home-centred education is as old as civilization itself, commencing long before public schools were organized or even conceived.” – Ballmann, 1995 From ‘Gurukul Parampara’ in ancient India to the period of colonialism, homeschooling has always been around for centuries. With the advent of industrialization, establishment of emphasis on education through schools began. Following the Civil War in America, education started becoming state-controlled with the sanctioning of compulsory attendance laws. The rest of the world eventually followed in. Gradually, the schools became categorised. Bureaucracy took a hold onto it. The founding principles took a jibe as schools designed with the purpose of inculcating moral and ethical values transformed into war rooms for jobs. “The idea is to educate, not follow anyone’s schedule about when something should be studied.” – Ray Drouillard The Rise of Homeschooling Homeschooling, an informal system of parent-led education at home, re-emerged in the 1970s. Before this phase, it was seen as an alternative form of education fringing at the periphery of mainstream educational systems but now it is prevailing on the borders of the conventional systems. The prominent reasons behind adoption of this alternate system against traditional schooling are cited as schools becoming too broad and not deep in learning, families’ preference for spending time with their children and providing individualized learning from nature, travel or ‘real-life sized books’. The other reasons include costs of schooling, learning at one’s own pace, self-selecting peers and avoiding the negative social influence and abuse in schools. The dark clouds of misconception levitating over the system of homeschooling include academic performance of homeschoolers, their social skills, and success in the real world. A wide range of studies by organizations such as NHERI, HSLDA, BBC, IGI Global, USNews and academic researchers such as Ray, Richman, and others have proven the efficacy of homeschooling. The home-educated typically obtain 15 to 30 percentile points higher than public-school students on standardized academic achievement tests such as SAT (Scholastic Aptitude Test) and ACT (American College Test). It was found that homeschoolers are increasingly recruited by colleges and 50% of the homeschoolers attend college (Ray, 2015). About 87% of the studies on social, emotional, and psychological development of the home-educated showed that they performed better than students from public schools and the difference was statistically significant. About 69% of the studies dealing with the success of homeschooled adults in the real world showed a statistically significant performance than adults with education from institutions (Ray, 2017). Homeschooling has grown impressively around the world. During March of 2021, around 8-9% of school-age going children accounting to 4.5 to 5 million were homeschoolers in the grades K-12 in the United States which previously accounted to 2.5 million, i.e., roughly 3-4% in the spring of 2019 (The U.S. Census Bureau (2021) and the U.S. Department of Education (2019)). This surge can be explained due to increased engagement of the parents with children during the pandemic’s lock-down. Is Homeschooling for Everyone? Parents play the role of protagonist in this saga of homeschooling. It requires a significant amount of time, is emotionally demanding, and requires structured planning. A right balance must be struck between their role as a teacher and a parent. Lack of conviction, feeling of incompetency and unpreparedness, disagreement between parents, discipline issues in children and parents, unrealistic goals and expectations, lack of personal time affecting their mental health, and financial strain along with other unforeseen situations are the most common reasons behind quitting of homeschooling by parents. These are serious issues to be addressed, failing which can have catastrophic outcomes. Homeschooling is not for parents who get anxious about learning delays or are about meeting standards on traditional skills such as literacy and numeracy. Are the schools becoming redundant? It is the ‘question of the hour’. The current lockdown and the changing work of people have opened their minds towards the possibilities of active learning at home. Anecdotal evidence suggests that many have withdrawn their children from conventional schools and are exploring homeschooling alternatives. However, home schooling not only requires a shift in mindset but also changing lifestyle preference. It is a commitment on part of the families to accept reduced or no work for at least one of the parents, for periods longer than a couple of years as it is an investment that yields results only in the long run. John Dewey, a renowned American philosopher, had said that “Education and learning are social and interactive processes, and thus the school itself is a social institution through which social reform can and should take place”. Dewey, a flag bearer of the constructivist approach to learning – inquiry- and experience-based learning, believed that in the presence of a ‘teacher’ or any other ‘more knowledgeable peer’, the process of learning would transform the student into an autonomous and self-efficient entity while mastering the content. Another popular theory, Social Learning (Albert Bandura, 1977), emphasizes that people learn through observations. This theory gave birth to the Social Cognitive theory which states that learning takes place in a social framework. It emphasizes the existence of a shared interaction among the environment, behaviour, and person. Conscious teachers act as scaffolds to learners reaching their zones of proximal development. The positive role models in the form of peers can foster desirable behaviours. Thus, at least the progressive schools with learner-focus are not redundant. Traditional school system is outdated globally because of the internet. Is Homeschooling Legal? In India, the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act (RTE) renders formal education as a right to children between 6 – 14 years of age. Homeschooling being an informal system of education is thus outside the purview of the government. Schools in India are not required to keep a record of schooling of students until Grade 7. This implies that the Government has left it to the discretion of the schools to accept homeschool learners back for participation in board examinations. Bodies such as the National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) have an OBE (Open Based Education) Programme operating at three levels – A (equivalent to Class I-III), B (equivalent to class IV-V), and C (equivalent to class VI-VIII). It also offers Secondary Course (equivalent to class X) and Senior Secondary Course (equivalent to class XII). In India, homeschooling can be practiced at home by following NIOS or NOS, and the Cambridge International Examination (IGCSE) that accepts private candidates. However, there is no provision of appearing as a private candidate in IB (International Baccalaureate) board. The universities in India do not accept private candidature in boards other than NIOS. There is an option for the parents to skip Grade 10 exam altogether and appear for A levels (Cambridge) directly. However, leading universities look for a consistent academic record and might ask for Grade 10 scores. Support for Homeschooling families Many other notable institutions providing homeschooling as an option to families in India include Wolsey Hall Oxford, 21K School and Prakriti. Wolsey Hall Oxford provides Cambridge courses,assignments, and mentors to parents for completing the academic requirement. Prakriti is an alternate school. It combines flexibility that homeschoolers need with the structure for alignment with Cambridge certification in Grade 10. Learners can participate in its classrooms that are all enquiry-led and assignments that are mostly research-based. They can choose to take the school’s diagnostic assessments. Prakriti provides social-emotional education through “circle time” and individual dialogues. It encourages the learners to participate in immersions in schools and outdoors. The individualised learning support at Prakriti’s small-sized classrooms offers differentiated learning based on interests and skills of the child. 21K School is an online school set up primarily to cater for those looking for virtual learning. Way forward in the new normal For parents who have been ‘homeschoolers for life’, the pandemic has only presented options for support from virtual schools. For parents of school-going children, who have gained confidence about supporting the child’s needs at home, the decision is whether to continue with homeschooling or not. Answer to this really depends on the aspirations of the family vis-a-vis certification, availability of resources and peer network both for the parent and the child as well the opportunity for the child to travel and learn. Fortunately, we have alternate schools like Prakriti offering a hybrid system of education that engages the learners individually and offers social learning. It is inevitable that the perspective on conventional schooling will change and schools will have to adapt to the new normal. However, whether the niches will become a mass movement is to be seen. As a century old experience of education of progressive and conventional schools in the US has told us, the masses equip themselves for industrialization of the time and not of the future. “We want education by which character is formed, strength of mind is increased, the intellect is expanded, and by which one can stand on one’s own feet.” – Swami Vivekananda Sources: Ray, Brian D.

Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts.

The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future.

In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious",

    "main_content": "Book Club, Power of Mantras and MathLab by Prakriti | Jan 20, 2021 Our learners warmed themselves up with several stimulating workshops during this winter-break. We had organised a Book Reading Club on The Last Gambit (Om Swami), a knowing and chanting session on Vedic Mantras and hands-on sessions on Experiential Mathematics. The feedback from the workshop participants has been been heart-warming. Book Club: We read the books online with Ms Meenakshi Puri, Prakriti’s English language facilitator (ex Sardar Patel Vidyalaya) and a litterateur. Besides interpreting the book, the learners understood how to listen, draw out personal opinions and disagree without resorting to emotional arguments. The Last gambit by venerable monk, Om Swami was an ideal selection for the middle schoolers who have big, hairy, audacious goals and go through the tumult of applying self-discipline and choosing the right mentors to realise their dreams. Power of Mantras: In this eight-part knowing and chanting workshop, the participants learnt the differences between vedic hymns and mantras from ancient texts and understood the relevance and meaning of the verses. They chanted as a daily and built their repertoire, The workshop was facilitated by the erudite Mukul Dwivedi, Prakriti’s mentor for Sanskrit language learning. Power of Mantras Math lab : We did exciting mathematical experiments with Saurabh Suri, a teacher, researcher and social worker. The ten days of engaging sessions covered the world of polygons and polyhedrons, fractions, measurements and numbers. Through concrete materials, the participants deepened their understanding of the concepts and dabbled in mathematical creativity much beyond the limits of the workshop.\n\n\n\n--- Substack Article ---\nCan We Save the Planet or Should We Save Ourselves?

    "main_content": "Glorious Greenery : Grade 3 by Prakriti | Dec 17, 2021 Grade 3 ( Happiness group) learnt about plants extensively through an interesting project called GLORIOUS GREENERY. Project method is a medium of instruction where the facilitator uses a collaborative approach with the learners, integrating aspects from various learning domains.We integrated languages (English and Hindi) and Art in the project. Learners explored the world of plants, starting from the journey of seed to become a plant and then how we are connected with plants emotionally and physically. We inculcated many activities like germination, growing plants, experiments related to essential elements plants need to grow, salad making and list of plants around us. These activities not only give learners experiential experience but also generate enthusiasm for learning.We concluded the project with a presentation which included a story composed by kids, Hindi poem recitation (on the parts of the plant) and a short quiz for parents. हमारी कविता कल जब मैं गई टहलने तो मुझे…… नन्हा सा एक बीज मिला, गोल-गोल और भूरा-भूरा। नरम नरम सा खिला खिला मैंने उसे उठाया, नन्हें बीज को हाथ लगाया इसके भीतर क्या क्या होगा ? मेरे मन में आया…. इसके अंदर पौधा होगा, जो पानी, हवा, रौशनी के बाद उगेगा। इसके अंदर होगी जड़, जो ज़मीन को लेगी पकड़, जाएगी खुद नीचे और भेजेगी पत्तों को ऊपर। इसके अंदर होगी एक चीज़, जो होगा शायद एक और छोटा सा बीज। इसके अंदर होंगे पत्ते, शायद थोड़े छोटे और थोड़े से बड़े! This project was a true example of how learning can be fun.\n\n\n\n--- Substack Article ---\nCan We Save the Planet or Should We Save Ourselves? Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts. Click here to read more about MannanA Campus Enriched by Nature's BountyOur landscape is a vibrant testament to our commitment to biodiversity and natural beauty. Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious",

They already have far too much of it. Instead, people need the ability to make sense of information, to tell the difference between what is important and what is unimportant, and above all, to combine many bits of information into a broad picture of the world.\" -Yuval Noah Harari, 21 Lessons for 21st Century How do we learn?How do we learn?“Learning takes place best through action. Learning is about becoming- who I might be. Learning is also highly social” Peter Senge, Professor at MIT and Author of The Fifth Discipline “Mind should be consulted in its growth. Education goes from Near to Far” Sri Aurobindo What do we want our children to be?We want our children to be...It is said that a 21st century learner should be curious, imaginative, oratorical and open-minded. We say simply, that children should grow to be happy. Happiness begins with freedom to explore and choose. It lasts with the feeling of selfless giving, i.e., loving kindness. Education should be joyful and make learners kind towards others and the environment. What does freedom mean for a learner?Free thinkers need to be free learnersChildren should be free to learn what they like to learn and in the way they learn the best. The role of a teacher or a parent is to reconnect a child’s personality with the inner swabhav or prakriti. A school should be the safe space to explore the learning domains and express freely. With this freedom, children also learn what they need to.

Confused about the modalities and complexities of home schooling, we chanced upon Prakriti. One visit to the school, and we both fell in love with the space and the concept. The last 8 years have only led to a reinforcement of our faith. Prakriti is a place where the children can just be – be free, be themselves, and become whoever or whatever they wish to be. As a medium of education, it has constantly encouraged our son to focus on conceptual understanding, following a practical approach towards learning. At an individual level, Prakriti has enhanced his mental and emotional quotients. In the most amazing way, didis and bhaiyas have understood him deeply as a person, rather than just a face in a crowded class. This has paved the way for his holistic development, and not merely academic growth. Prakriti has provided a stimulating atmosphere with games, music, art and meditation – teaching him to be independent and be able to think for himself. Even we, as parents, have matured, thanks to relentless focus on a synchronised home environment. Group sessions, as well as one-to-one counselling have been a constant feature in our lives. Prakriti, for us, is not just school, it is a community. And our younger one, too, has been added to it recently. Borrowing a line from the Prakriti anthem (ideated by my 2-year old), “Bachhon ke naam hain anek, ek naam hai Prakriti”. Arunima Jain Mother-Ivaan (unity group) & Mishka (Red Group) I’m privileged to give my below testimonial for our Prakriti: Prakriti has a deep meaning as it reflects “Nature” its serenity and happiness to be on its own, henceforth what else could be better to up bring our kids under the blessings of Nature such that they may transform not only to an educated and learned person but importantly they learn to learn the process of learning . The way kids name their group y-o-y basis is a true reflection of that they have become inherent part of our nature as given by their own Prakriti. The way they learn new things and use them in their day to day life is phenomenal as then they have imbibed the learning and not only learnt to forget subsequently , I always say with conviction that things we learn from nature like swimming is something one will never forget in his /her life , similarly what kids learn and grow with under shelters of Prakriti is incredible and unforgettable not only the learning but the way they have learned it . The way Prakriti infuses the technological advancement is an exemplification of their vision and the efforts they put in to bring this so simplistically and seamlessly is classic case of their being grounded to nature as nature is actually simple , we human beings make it so complicated and cumbersome to satisfy ourselves only. The pedagogy adopted by Prakriti not only helps our kids to gradually grow and start questioning to explore reasons , do research and get into discussions but immensely enables parents to keep up the pace with their way of learning and upkeep our learning zeal. We feel so proud to see how such kids get so comfortable in handling complicated topics and getting prepared to take on tasks with an open mind and bent of mind “agree to disagree”. What’s even more fascinating about the Prakriti is the integrated and cohesive approach which blends all aspects of overall development , the emphasis on to be strong by eating healthy and getting onto sporting activity even under limited resources and curtailed environment like the one we all are going through since Mar’20 under pandemic shows the affinity and broad vision of Prakriti which not only nurtures our kids but upping’s and enable them to tread their journey in this world facing all headwinds with courage and strength. Last but not the least the passion with which all Didi & Bhaiya’s get involved with our kids is something which we as parents couldn’t have imagined , their accessibility and binding with kids is overwhelming and nostalgic , their desire to bring-in new ways , give them exposure to explore awesome places , learn to be compassionate with the culture and lifestyle of natives , make kids relish the serenity of nature is beyond words and can only be felt just like nature which our kids do with enthu and are always excited for more and more . In nutshell I can say with conviction that if we are not part of Prakriti then we are keeping ur kids away from nature and if our kids aren’t bought-up under nature then we as parents can reflect back as how our upbringing has been and can very well answer to ourselves. So let me conclude by posing back few questions as “Why not Prakriti” ? “If not Prakriti then What “ ? “Are we not stealing best upbringing from our innocent kids by not keeping them under shelters of Prakriti”? I SAY FROM CORE OF MY HEART THAT LET PRAKRITI BLOSSOM AS ITS PRAKRITI WHICH WILL PREPARE / EMPOWER & LAUNCH OUR KIDS IN THIS WORLD TO BRING & SPREAD TRUE REJOICE AKIN TO NATURE Dheeraj Jain Father of Dhruv Jain (Grade VI) Prakriti is a way of life… When you join Prakriti, not only do you enrol your child, – you enrol yourself to a journey of learning and unlearning, to going back to the basics – to simple joys. Many memories rush to mind whenever someone asks about Prakriti, and to us few things have always stood out. We had just enrolled our child in pre-school program and were being briefed by Shilpa Didi, and she said, when we tell our children, “Pyar se” we should also softly, reassuringly touch the child while saying so. This tactile, soothing approach helps the child to calm down and experience those words in a holistic sensory way. This has been so-so helpful. No one teaches you how to be parents – but at Prakriti you get a chance to be good ones! The other has to be the Day care program. We had looked far and wide and never could settle on anything. In fact one renowned place had laughed at us when I asked what kind of stories they tell their 1.5 yrs old… When you embrace Prakriti, you inherit a village – the care, affection, attention that the children get in Day care is second to none. One day, I was trying to sleep with a migraine, my 5.5 yr old comes up and starts rubbing my forehead – “Deepa Didi aise hi karti thin jab hum so nahi paate the.” There is so much more that can be said. No words can do enough justice. The good part is that everyone “sees” your child. All you have to do is commit to the experience. Last but not the least will have to be how everyone addresses each other – Didi and Bhaiya. Allowing the child to be free of any hierarchy and bureaucracy teaches them the value of respect, and oneness that no lesson can teach. Sumi Tandon Mother of Vishnu Mehrotra (Grade 1) Six weeks have passed since Tej joined Alt school with Prakriti, and a day hasn’t gone by when he doesn’t eagerly await his LIVE learning sessions. I stress upon LIVE as the sessions truly bring learning to life. Whether it’s the weather that’s in discussion, or observing patterns in everything around, it has opened Tej to new and interesting ways of looking at life and at himself. The boy who was once intimidated and struggled to read past a page of a story book, today confidently reads 4-5 books a day, comprehends them, and has developed the ability to interpret the same. He keeps a daily journal recording his ‘inner weather’ which he proudly reads to us like a novella 🙂 All this in just 6 weeks! Learning/ teaching online can be challenging, yet the group discussions have lent space for individual thinking and have been active and lively; delivered with such patience and respect; while maintaining discipline at the same time. But most of all, Tej feels loved 🙂 A big shout of THANK YOU to Aditi and Mehak Didi’s for nurturing Tej and his peers with so much care, sensitivity and equanimity. The time Didi’s have spent beyond class hours to fix his matras and listen to his endless ramblings have not gone unnoticed, and is well appreciated. Tej feels at home with the two of you, and wonders when he might travel to meet you all in person 🙂 No doubt there is still a lot of ground to cover, but we are so thankful for a great start, and hope the program sustains even post lockdown. If we were to judge how wealthy we are on the happiness scale, Tej would be a millionaire! Thank you all for keeping his spark alive. Meera George Mother of Tej Matthew (Home School Support) When we started looking for a place where our child could settle down while the two of us went to work, we came across a number of places that made us realise that it was going to be a difficult task finding a good daycare for our son. Our search led us to Prakriti, which was just a few years old. There was something quite reassuring about this place from the moment we got there—and it had to do with its people, its architecture, its ethos and most importantly the way in which they interacted with children, whether they be four months old or six years old. Though they had never taken care of such small children, they agreed to be our partners on this journey. We have been with Prakriti for six years now and our son is very well settled here—it is practically his second home, he is so comfortable with the space and the people he interacts with in this space. Prakriti runs a very good daycare programme and we would recommend it to all parents who are looking for something similar. Shashank Singh Father of Angad (Grade 3) “Prakriti daycare is built in a very warm, cosy and close to nature space, with lots of lush greenery, a small habitat for animals like rabbits and fishes, and quite open play areas and enclosed ones. The daycare had become a second home to my toddler. It is indeed a place where as a parent I felt secure and glad to send my child, as it provided an environment where children feel loved, nurtured and free to explore their surroundings. The daycare staff is quite friendly and helpful, and they also provide healthy food to kids. “Keep growing Prakriti!” Sameer Bhatt Father of Anayh Bhatt (Day Care)\n\n--- Substack Article ---\nCan We Save the Planet or Should We Save Ourselves? Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts. Click here to read more about MannanA Campus Enriched by Nature's BountyOur landscape is a vibrant testament to our commitment to biodiversity and natural beauty. Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious",

    "main_content": "Presentation of Learning in Music by Grades 1-3 by Prakriti | Mar 9, 2021 Our Grades 1,2,3 spent last four months learning Indian classical vocals and flute guided by Arupa Roy, a renowned music and dance artist. The children from the grades: Joy (Grade 1), Rainbow (2) and Sunrise (3) took part in Music POL with great enthusiasm. We were apprehensive of doing a musical performance in the online mode but that went away quickly as recorded videos came to our rescue. Some of the children also performed live and their renditions were a treat to watch. The POL began with a mesmerizing performance by Rajat Bhaiya (Music Facilitator) who played a beautiful tone on flute. We then went ahead with the Live and Recorded performances by the children. The children had performed on the songs they had been practicing in the Music sessions. It was fascinating to see them singing songs and playing flute on songs such as Jingle Bells, 500 miles, Hum honge kamyaab, Paayo ji maine ram ratan, Meera bhajan and so on. The children participated in the POL with zeal and zest and made the POL more lively. The day ended with a few surprises as some impromptu performances came our way which was a feast to our eyes and ears. We are sharing few performances of our learners: Joy Group Flute Rainbow Group Flute Sunrise Group Flute Joy Group Vocal Rainbow Group Vocal Sunrise Group Vocal\n\n\n\n--- Substack Article ---\nCan We Save the Planet or Should We Save Ourselves? Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts. Click here to read more about MannanA Campus Enriched by Nature's BountyOur landscape is a vibrant testament to our commitment to biodiversity and natural beauty. Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious",

The plot of the story is a conflict between two kings and the act deploys humour and puppetry as the tools. Here is what our language and drama facilitator Fahim Bhaiya has to say about the play: दीपावली के विशेष अवसर पर ‘ ट्रुथ एंड करेज प्रोग्राम ‘ के तहत कक्षा छ: लुमिनोसिटी ग्रुप के छात्रों ने ‘ कठपुतली का राजा ‘ नामक नाटक की प्रस्तुति तैयार की जिसकी मूलसंवेदना है कठिन समय में बैर-भाव को दूर करते हुए मदद करना। इसे कठपुतलियों के अभिनय के द्वारा, कविता और संवादों के माध्यम से दर्शाया गया है। नाटक में दो राजाओं के बीच जंग होने वाली है। दोनों राजाओं को जंग पर जाना है। एक राजा योध्दाओं वाले कपड़े पहने हुए , अपनी तलवार, ढाल और भाला लेकर मैदान में आता है तथा दूसरा राजा जो हर अवसर पर सज-संवरकर के रहना पसंद करता है, भले ही जंग लड़ने क्यों न जाने हो ? और जंग लड़ने के लिए तलवार और ढाल की जगह शीशा ले जाता है तो क्या होता होगा ? दुश्मन राजा से कैसे सामना करता होगा ? जब कोई संकट आता होगा तो उसका उपाय कैसे निकालता होगा ? इन्हीं सब घटनाओं को लुमिनोसिटी ग्रुप के छात्रों ने बड़े ही रोचक तरीके से दिखाया है।\n\n\n\n--- Substack Article ---\nCan We Save the Planet or Should We Save Ourselves?

Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts. Click here to read more about MannanA Campus Enriched by Nature's BountyOur landscape is a vibrant testament to our commitment to biodiversity and natural beauty. Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious",

    "main_content": "Celebration of Generosity and Truth & Courage by Prakriti | Jan 20, 2022 Every October and December, we celebrate the virtues of Truth, Courage and Generosity. Learners contribute their belongings for exchanging within the community and lead the drives for collection of clothes, books, toys and blankets for the needy within their communities. On Generosity celebration, celebrated around Christmas, the learners are free to interpret it in their context and develop their stories into plays or even political debates. For instance, while our Grade 6 acted on a play to display nature’s supremacy over other living beings in Sanskrit, our Grade 8 renegotiated the Treaty of Versailles so that the worst wars in modern history could be avoided. On Truth & Courage, celebrated around Diwali, everyone in school enjoys the serving community lunch to one another. Festivity is expressed through art, singing and folk dances. Dariya Dil Dukaan is set up in the school for children to give away what they don’t need and take what they do, with expression of gratitude.\n\n\n\n--- Substack Article ---\nCan We Save the Planet or Should We Save Ourselves?

Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts. Click here to read more about MannanA Campus Enriched by Nature's BountyOur landscape is a vibrant testament to our commitment to biodiversity and natural beauty. Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious",

    "title": "\"Me and Myself\" (A Grade 3 Project) - Prakriti",
    "description": "",
    "main_content": "“Me and Myself” (A Grade 3 Project) by Prakriti | Dec 6, 2020 This project was taken with the need to create self awareness in students. The project began with a small activity where few statements were given to the students about themselves and few movements were attached to it. They were supposed to do that movement if that statement was correct for them, for example-: Turn around if you like Broccoli Tickle your palm if you have a brother Make a weird face if you like to swim Shake your hands if you are afraid of dogs, etc. This activity became a warm up as well as a hint for students about what we’ll do in the class and what would be the focus of the class. Then in the class itself we did a worksheet on “What I like to” so this had 4 questions-: What I like to eat and why What I like to wear and why What I like to do and why What I like to play with and why These specific questions were given to students as at age 6-7 if we ask them to write about themselves then that becomes too abstract for them. Therefore, to bring their thought process to themselves and to let them think what actually belongs to them or what are their likes and dislikes, these specific questions were taken. Gradually we moved ahead with concrete things. It was a stupendous journey! Children came out with great writings and thoughts. When the students were given the worksheet on “what I like to and why” we got amazing answers from them. Apart from self awareness reasoning skills were also getting worked on. Then we moved ahead with asking students about their “favourite fruit” and few questions were attached in the instructions like-: Why do you like this fruit? How do you like it to be served? Apart from your home, where do you get to see this fruit? Students gave various reasons for a particular fruit and various ways of serving that fruit. When this task was discussed in the class, students took many ideas from their peers as well about how different fruits can be served. We took topic favorite fruit after “what I like to do” as it was summer time and students would get various reasons to justify their choices. After discussing this in the class, we moved on to the “Animals”. Some animals were shown to the students and they had to associate some qualities to them. Some of the qualities that they came out with were loving, friendly, sleepy, naughty, etc. In order to record every child’s response a PowerPoint presentation was made and all the responses of the children were recorded. After this a home task was given to the students, where they were asked “if you were an animal what would you be? Why? They had to write a paragraph on this. When students submitted their writings, the reasons that they focused were the qualities/characteristics of that particular animal. They wanted to become like that so that they can also live a life like them. By now, they were looking deep into the qualities or characteristics that define a particular animal. When we discussed the task in the class, few students had chosen similar animals. But, their reasons were different from each other. This is the point where they understood about their uniqueness, their individual choices with the reasons. Next, we took a story named “hamara john” . This story talked about the individual differences and qualities that are intrinsic and these are what makes us different from each other. After reading the story students were asked some questions like-: Did you like the story? Why or Why not? Which character did you like the most and Why? List down some of the qualities of John. What would you have done, if you had found an abandoned egg? The answers that we got from the students were really thought provoking, students did a deep thinking to answer the questions. Here from the story what we wanted to let students think on is how to do things independently. So, the next task students had was to list down things that they can’t do independently, they can do independently now and things that they want to do independently now but are unable to. Once listing was done they were asked to reflect on how they can make themselves independent, students gave great answers like by practising things, by observing how they are being done, etc. From here, we moved to “things that you like to make or create”, students had various things to share and they told various things that they liked to make. All their responses were added in the PowerPoint presentation, where it was visible to everyone and all the students were listening as well as reading each other’s points. Student’s various answers were like-: dance steps, Madhubani paintings, floral decorations, motor fans, etc. after discussing this in the class, the students were given a home task where they had to answer 4 questions that were-: What are some of the challenges you face while making or creating what you like? Are you able to overcome those challenges? If yes, then how? If not, then what are some of the ways to overcome those challenges? The focus here was to ask students that when they create something new, what all difficulties they go through. If there was a challenge or conflict while doing that then how did they resolve it. This activity made students think about conflict and its resolution. We had an immersing discussion around what students have created? what challenges they had faced? and how would they overcome that? Every child was asked one by one and their responses were added to the power point presentation simultaneously. Others could also see the responses and read them as well. After this we moved ahead by asking students what are their individual goals for this year. This made students think in the direction about what they can improve this year. After discussing their goals they were asked, how they were planning to achieve their goals. Students themselves found solutions to their own problems and what they have to do to improve things that they can’t do independently now. Then the focus was brought to the hobbies of the children. In order to make them think about their hobbies, first they were asked what they are good at. Once they got an answer to this question, they were asked what they would do, when they get bored. This made them think about what they like to do the most and what they are good at. We moved ahead in the project by asking students that since these days we all are at home for the entire day, so what do you like the most about being at home? Students gave very bright answers, they mentioned that they were doing things/ activities that wasn’t very frequent to them like spending quality time with family, bird watching, playing with toys, yoga, etc., Then they were asked about their favorite spot in the house, so that we can talk to them about at which place they feel good and peaceful, and they can describe their feelings. Next we started talking about their families and what family means to them. Here, we wanted students to focus on how their personalities are being formed by their family. Moving ahead, the students were asked if they have any pattern in their body and is that symmetrical or not? From there we brought in the concept of horizontal and vertical symmetry, this gave them the awareness of how their body looks like. Then students were asked to write a poem on “Maths in me”. From there, we moved to My body. Now, we started talking about the body. Being aware of oneself is a major part of self awareness. Since we were dealing with 6-7 years of age students, we did quick riddles on guessing the body parts and students were really quick! We integrated the body with mathematics and students were asked to find mathematics around them. Once they were done with this, we asked the students to categorize their body parts into-: Uni, single, one Duo, couplet, two, pair Many, three or more, countable Uncountable Along with categorizing body parts under different heads, they were also seeing synonyms for different words. After completing this they were asked to make a portrait of their body and they had to mark different body parts as uni, duo, many, uncountable. Making a portrait makes the concept clear and gives them a justification of whatever they have categorized is correct or not.

Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts. Click here to read more about MannanA Campus Enriched by Nature's BountyOur landscape is a vibrant testament to our commitment to biodiversity and natural beauty. Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious",

AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts.

Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious",

    "main_content": "Prakriti at Model United Nations by Prakriti | Aug 6, 2022 Prakriti’s Grade 8 and 9 learners participated in their first Model United Nations Event at Scottish High International School. The event was intense with each committee having about 30-40 delegates from a variety of schools. What attracted the learners was the depth of the agendas that the committees were exploring, from Oil funding of FIFA to Glass Ceiling for the Women in Companies to Feasibility of Non-proliferation in light of Iran’s Nuclear Deal and Pakistan’s WMD to Stakeholder vs Shareholder Capitalism. A refreshing change was inclusion of Lok Sabha for discussing the ban on Cryptocurrency and Crisis Committee Meetings for Indira Gandhi for 1971 war. At the MUN, they were expected to make speeches, participate in the various discussions and debates (that often got intense), withstand scrutiny from fellow delegates and answer their questions, and work with them to come up with resolutions. It was wonderful to see how each of the students’ responded to this very new and rigourous environment. While most took time to get accustomed to the pace, energy and tension in the atmosphere, by the end of the first day, they all eventually got a grip on themselves and were participating vigourously. The second day was more fruitful for most of them and one student from G9 was even especially recognized for her contributions to the deliberations in her committee. MUNs are a test of one’s grit, focus on self and learning from initial setbacks for improvising on one’s delivery of thought and questioning of others’ ideas. While everyone who thrives in an event such as this is a winner, two of our learners were awarded with a Special Mention!\n\n\n\n--- Substack Article ---\nCan We Save the Planet or Should We Save Ourselves? Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits.

We are cognisant of the fitness and social learning needs of our learners who have been deprived of what they loved to do the most- meet and play with their friends and didis. Every Monday, Prakriti invites its learners in small groups for cycling. We started with India Gate, which has become a haven for cyclists and skaters owing to the ensuing lockdown. Parents and their didis/bhaiyas come out together for a joyful ride in the midst of nature. Now, the beautiful Monday mornings are spent cycling at Noida Stadium, keeping in mind all the precautions for safety from COVID. A good monsoon morning, pollution-free air with social distancing rules is what we need to reinvigorate our schedules.\n\n\n\n--- Substack Article ---\nCan We Save the Planet or Should We Save Ourselves?

Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts. Click here to read more about MannanA Campus Enriched by Nature's BountyOur landscape is a vibrant testament to our commitment to biodiversity and natural beauty. Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious",

Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits.

Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community.

They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts.

Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious",

Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness.

    "description": "",
    "main_content": "What our parents say about us by Prakriti | Aug 15, 2020 For my husband and me, conventional schooling was never an option for our son. Confused about the modalities and complexities of home schooling, we chanced upon Prakriti. One visit to the school, and we both fell in love with the space and the concept. The last 8 years have only led to a reinforcement of our faith. Prakriti is a place where the children can just be – be free, be themselves, and become whoever or whatever they wish to be. As a medium of education, it has constantly encouraged our son to focus on conceptual understanding, following a practical approach towards learning. At an individual level, Prakriti has enhanced his mental and emotional quotients. In the most amazing way, didis and bhaiyas have understood him deeply as a person, rather than just a face in a crowded class. This has paved the way for his holistic development, and not merely academic growth. Prakriti has provided a stimulating atmosphere with games, music, art and meditation – teaching him to be independent and be able to think for himself. Even we, as parents, have matured, thanks to relentless focus on a synchronised home environment. Group sessions, as well as one-to-one counselling have been a constant feature in our lives. Prakriti, for us, is not just school, it is a community. And our younger one, too, has been added to it recently. Borrowing a line from the Prakriti anthem (ideated by my 2-year old), “Bachhon ke naam hain anek, ek naam hai Prakriti”. Arunima Jain Mother-Ivaan (unity group) & Mishka (Red Group) I’m privileged to give my below testimonial for our Prakriti: Prakriti has a deep meaning as it reflects “Nature” its serenity and happiness to be on its own, henceforth what else could be better to up bring our kids under the blessings of Nature such that they may transform not only to an educated and learned person but importantly they learn to learn the process of learning . The way kids name their group y-o-y basis is a true reflection of that they have become inherent part of our nature as given by their own Prakriti. The way they learn new things and use them in their day to day life is phenomenal as then they have imbibed the learning and not only learnt to forget subsequently , I always say with conviction that things we learn from nature like swimming is something one will never forget in his /her life , similarly what kids learn and grow with under shelters of Prakriti is incredible and unforgettable not only the learning but the way they have learned it . The way Prakriti infuses the technological advancement is an exemplification of their vision and the efforts they put in to bring this so simplistically and seamlessly is classic case of their being grounded to nature as nature is actually simple , we human beings make it so complicated and cumbersome to satisfy ourselves only. The pedagogy adopted by Prakriti not only helps our kids to gradually grow and start questioning to explore reasons , do research and get into discussions but immensely enables parents to keep up the pace with their way of learning and upkeep our learning zeal. We feel so proud to see how such kids get so comfortable in handling complicated topics and getting prepared to take on tasks with an open mind and bent of mind “agree to disagree”. What’s even more fascinating about the Prakriti is the integrated and cohesive approach which blends all aspects of overall development , the emphasis on to be strong by eating healthy and getting onto sporting activity even under limited resources and curtailed environment like the one we all are going through since Mar’20 under pandemic shows the affinity and broad vision of Prakriti which not only nurtures our kids but upping’s and enable them to tread their journey in this world facing all headwinds with courage and strength. Last but not the least the passion with which all Didi & Bhaiya’s get involved with our kids is something which we as parents couldn’t have imagined , their accessibility and binding with kids is overwhelming and nostalgic , their desire to bring-in new ways , give them exposure to explore awesome places , learn to be compassionate with the culture and lifestyle of natives , make kids relish the serenity of nature is beyond words and can only be felt just like nature which our kids do with enthu and are always excited for more and more . In nutshell I can say with conviction that if we are not part of Prakriti then we are keeping ur kids away from nature and if our kids aren’t bought-up under nature then we as parents can reflect back as how our upbringing has been and can very well answer to ourselves. So let me conclude by posing back few questions as “Why not Prakriti” ? “If not Prakriti then What “ ? “Are we not stealing best upbringing from our innocent kids by not keeping them under shelters of Prakriti”? I SAY FROM CORE OF MY HEART THAT LET PRAKRITI BLOSSOM AS ITS PRAKRITI WHICH WILL PREPARE / EMPOWER & LAUNCH OUR KIDS IN THIS WORLD TO BRING & SPREAD TRUE REJOICE AKIN TO NATURE Dheeraj Jain Father of Dhruv Jain (Grade VI) Prakriti is a way of life… When you join Prakriti, not only do you enrol your child, – you enrol yourself to a journey of learning and unlearning, to going back to the basics – to simple joys. Many memories rush to mind whenever someone asks about Prakriti, and to us few things have always stood out. We had just enrolled our child in pre-school program and were being briefed by Shilpa Didi, and she said, when we tell our children, “Pyar se” we should also softly, reassuringly touch the child while saying so. This tactile, soothing approach helps the child to calm down and experience those words in a holistic sensory way. This has been so-so helpful. No one teaches you how to be parents – but at Prakriti you get a chance to be good ones! The other has to be the Day care program. We had looked far and wide and never could settle on anything. In fact one renowned place had laughed at us when I asked what kind of stories they tell their 1.5 yrs old… When you embrace Prakriti, you inherit a village – the care, affection, attention that the children get in Day care is second to none. One day, I was trying to sleep with a migraine, my 5.5 yr old comes up and starts rubbing my forehead – “Deepa Didi aise hi karti thin jab hum so nahi paate the.” There is so much more that can be said. No words can do enough justice. The good part is that everyone “sees” your child. All you have to do is commit to the experience. Last but not the least will have to be how everyone addresses each other – Didi and Bhaiya. Allowing the child to be free of any hierarchy and bureaucracy teaches them the value of respect, and oneness that no lesson can teach. Sumi Tandon Mother of Vishnu Mehrotra (Grade 1) Six weeks have passed since Tej joined Alt school with Prakriti, and a day hasn’t gone by when he doesn’t eagerly await his LIVE learning sessions. I stress upon LIVE as the sessions truly bring learning to life. Whether it’s the weather that’s in discussion, or observing patterns in everything around, it has opened Tej to new and interesting ways of looking at life and at himself. The boy who was once intimidated and struggled to read past a page of a story book, today confidently reads 4-5 books a day, comprehends them, and has developed the ability to interpret the same. He keeps a daily journal recording his ‘inner weather’ which he proudly reads to us like a novella 🙂 All this in just 6 weeks! Learning/ teaching online can be challenging, yet the group discussions have lent space for individual thinking and have been active and lively; delivered with such patience and respect; while maintaining discipline at the same time. But most of all, Tej feels loved 🙂 A big shout of THANK YOU to Aditi and Mehak Didi’s for nurturing Tej and his peers with so much care, sensitivity and equanimity. The time Didi’s have spent beyond class hours to fix his matras and listen to his endless ramblings have not gone unnoticed, and is well appreciated. Tej feels at home with the two of you, and wonders when he might travel to meet you all in person 🙂 No doubt there is still a lot of ground to cover, but we are so thankful for a great start, and hope the program sustains even post lockdown. If we were to judge how wealthy we are on the happiness scale, Tej would be a millionaire! Thank you all for keeping his spark alive. Meera George Mother of Tej Matthew (Home School Support) When we started looking for a place where our child could settle down while the two of us went to work, we came across a number of places that made us realise that it was going to be a difficult task finding a good daycare for our son. Our search led us to Prakriti, which was just a few years old. There was something quite reassuring about this place from the moment we got there—and it had to do with its people, its architecture, its ethos and most importantly the way in which they interacted with children, whether they be four months old or six years old. Though they had never taken care of such small children, they agreed to be our partners on this journey. We have been with Prakriti for six years now and our son is very well settled here—it is practically his second home, he is so comfortable with the space and the people he interacts with in this space. Prakriti runs a very good daycare programme and we would recommend it to all parents who are looking for something similar. Shashank Singh Father of Angad (Grade 3) “Prakriti daycare is built in a very warm, cosy and close to nature space, with lots of lush greenery, a small habitat for animals like rabbits and fishes, and quite open play areas and enclosed ones. The daycare had become a second home to my toddler. It is indeed a place where as a parent I felt secure and glad to send my child, as it provided an environment where children feel loved, nurtured and free to explore their surroundings. The daycare staff is quite friendly and helpful, and they also provide healthy food to kids. “Keep growing Prakriti!” Sameer Bhatt Father of Anayh Bhatt (Day Care)\n\n\n\n--- Substack Article ---\nCan We Save the Planet or Should We Save Ourselves? Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts. Click here to read more about MannanA Campus Enriched by Nature's BountyOur landscape is a vibrant testament to our commitment to biodiversity and natural beauty. Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious",

Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts. Click here to read more about MannanA Campus Enriched by Nature's BountyOur landscape is a vibrant testament to our commitment to biodiversity and natural beauty. Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious  TEAM_MEMBER: Mentor (Early Years Education) TEAM_MEMBER: Founding Director TEAM_MEMBER: Chairperson and Chief Mentor TEAM_MEMBER: School Director & Early Yrs Mentor TEAM_MEMBER: Principal TEAM_MEMBER: Innovation Lead & Sr School Mentor TEAM_MEMBER: Special Needs Education Mentor KNOWN_MEMBER: Vinita Krishna KNOWN_MEMBER: Bharti Batra KNOWN_MEMBER: Shilpa Tayal KNOWN_MEMBER: Mridul Batra KNOWN_MEMBER: Rahul Batra",

Early learners at Prakriti are given ample time with sand, clay, mud, suji (semolina), water, natural colours, food items, objects in nature and beads which helps in cognitive development and gross motor skills. Red Group Newsletter Our children are supported & encouraged to grow their intrinsic love & deepen their connect with nature. We have a carefully designed curriculum to stimulate the joy of movement, observation and enquiry. On any given day, children are observing flowers, birds, leaves or insects. They question what intrigues them and express their learning through art and vocabulary. Children learn to express themselves best in their native language. Other languages are best developed through interaction with other children. Learners in our pre primary groups are given abundant exposure to develop their speech through singing, poetry, chanting & storytelling to enable a command over language. Primary School Inner discipline or developing self-control through awareness and compassion for others is a very important part our curriculum. Learner have a circle-time every day to reflect on the day and share their feelings and spend a few minutes in silence. Reflection writing is a key practice of our currciulum. Inner discipline or developing self-control through awareness and compassion for others is a very important part our curriculum. Learner have a circle-time every day to reflect on the day and share their feelings and spend a few minutes in silence. Reflection writing is a key practice of our currciulum. We teach language and math in the context of children’s familiar environment with interdisciplinary learning methods. Each project and reflection involves creative expression and numbers. We assess critical thinking and creativity in language and math rather than testing memory-based concepts. LANGUAGES & MATHEMATICS Children spend at least two days in a week at a farm, growing fruits and vegetables and have a daily schedule of physical activity where each child participates to develop stamina and strength. We have a robust arts programme where every child learns visual art, theatre, vocal and instrumental music. Art Samples Middle School Programme Our curriculum for 6-10 has been inspired by IGCSE. We believe that the curriculum offers adequate flexibility to adapt the subject structure to a student’s interests. For grades 11-12, we will offer Cambridge A Levels certification as we believe it provides academic choices with significant rigour in the domain learning. We teach languages with creative writing modules. Learners go through modules of Visual and Performing Arts, Theatre and Music. Sciences are taught with in-class maker tools and Social Sciences with conducting community interviews, observing artefacts, debating social issues and simulating era through exhibits. A Grade 6 Presentation We enrich the core subjects with maker and design labs, outbound immersions and individualised learning pathways that scaffold the adolescent phase of learning. Middle school learners spend at least a day/week night in a month in school to get deeper into core learning domains with support of their peers Bridge Programme We work on both mainstreaming and inclusive strategies to address learners with special needs. Children with special needs are included in all celebrations including the sports day and theatre. Music and art programme is planned carefully keeping the therapeutic effects in mind. While we run an extensive learning difficulties management programme, we also invest in making our mainstream student and parent community more inclusive and compassionate. We believe that acceptance and accommodation will be a key attribute for the adults of tomorrow. Read More We have a skilled team of special educators, behavioural, occupational, voice and speech therapists. Special needs children are provided individualised support within and outside the classrooms alongwith coaching of the parents and guardians to scaffold their learning process. Home School Support (IGCSE) We supprr Home School learners in once a week contact model. Home schoolers meet our facilitators online and join the school once a week (if in Delhi/Gurgaon) or for 10 days in a quarter, if not residing in NCR Assessments: Learners are assessed using formative and summative assessments. In Grade 10, IGCSE examination is conducted at school. Outdoor Learning: Home School learners are invited to be part of outward bound immersions as well as school events. Day Boarding Our day care facilitators are warm and caring and ensure that the day boarders have a restful and fruitful learning time in company of their peers. Empathy is the number one skill set we look for while hiring our facilitators. We have provided day boarding facility to our learners and for the benefit of the community around us. Day boarding for us is not just care but also active engagement with outdoor sports and indoor games as well as community events post school. Our day care works round the year (without vacation) from morning till evening. One can choose flexibly between full day or half-day stays. Our transport operates for pick and drop facility for the day boarders.\n\n\n\n--- Substack Article ---\nCan We Save the Planet or Should We Save Ourselves? Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts. Click here to read more about MannanA Campus Enriched by Nature's BountyOur landscape is a vibrant testament to our commitment to biodiversity and natural beauty. Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious",

    "main_content": "Home School Support Programme Launched by Prakriti | Jul 1, 2020 The Monsoon term saw the launch of Prakriti’s Home School Support Programme or “altPrakriti”. Our way of learning that is individualised and relies heavily on learning with projects and inter-disciplinary expression aligns well with the work discipline of home school learners. Currently we have around five home schoolers enrolled in Grades 2-7. They add to the classrooms the diversity of their regional backgrounds, as most of them are non- NCR based. We have been receiving glowing feedback from the learners and their parents on effectiveness of their participation in our classes. One of those follows: Dear Prakriti school, I hope my mail finds you all in the best of health and spirit. Six weeks have passed since Tej joined Alt school with Prakriti, and a day hasn’t gone by when he doesn’t eagerly await his LIVE learning sessions. I stress upon LIVE as the sessions truly bring learning to life. Whether it’s the weather that’s in discussion, or observing patterns in everything around, it has opened Tej to new and interesting ways of looking at life and at himself. The boy who was once intimidated and struggled to read past a page of a story book, today confidently reads 4-5 books a day, comprehends them, and has developed the ability to interpret the same. He keeps a daily journal recording his ‘inner weather’ which he proudly reads to us like a novella 🙂 All this in just 6 weeks! Learning/ teaching online can be challenging, yet the group discussions have lent space for individual thinking and have been active and lively; delivered with such patience and respect; while maintaining discipline at the same time. But most of all, Tej feels loved 🙂 A big shout of THANK YOU to Aditi and Mehak Didi’s for nurturing Tej and his peers with so much care, sensitivity and equanimity. The time Didi’s have spent beyond class hours to fix his matras and listen to his endless ramblings have not gone unnoticed, and is well appreciated. Tej feels at home with the two of you, and wonders when he might travel to meet you all in person 🙂 No doubt there is still a lot of ground to cover, but we are so thankful for a great start, and hope the program sustains even post lockdown. If we were to judge how wealthy we are on the happiness scale, Tej would be a millionaire! Thank you all for keeping his spark alive. Warm regards, Meera George\n\n\n\n--- Substack Article ---\nCan We Save the Planet or Should We Save Ourselves? Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts. Click here to read more about MannanA Campus Enriched by Nature's BountyOur landscape is a vibrant testament to our commitment to biodiversity and natural beauty. Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious",

    "main_content": "Launching IGCSE Design & Technology Course by Prakriti | May 14, 2022 We began teaching Design & Technology under the Cambridge (IGCSE) programme to our incoming Grade 9 this year. As an immersive workshop before starting the coursework, they worked on an automated hand sanitiser prototype. Learners were given the brief to research, design and manufacture a prototype hand sanitiser dispenser for a user of their choice in the style of an existing designer. The project aimed to introduce learners to design and technology by merging graphic design and systems and control disciplines. The research involved analysing existing dispensers, creating a designer moodboard and interviewing a user. Learners were inspired by designers including Gerrit Rietveld and Louis Comfort Tiffany. Through the analysis and user interviews, learners decided how their dispenser should work. They created flow diagrams to understand the workings of automatic hand sanitiser dispensers using sensors. Some groups opted to use Arduino kits to program and create a touchless dispenser and other groups opted to use a switch connected to a motor and battery. Using what they learnt in their research, learners sketched designs and worked in groups or independently to make their prototypes. They used corrugated cardboard to make the structure before installing the sanitiser dispenser mechanisms. The next step in the design process would be to test and evaluate their products, gather user feedback and plan refinements.\n\n\n\n--- Substack Article ---\nCan We Save the Planet or Should We Save Ourselves?

Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts. Click here to read more about MannanA Campus Enriched by Nature's BountyOur landscape is a vibrant testament to our commitment to biodiversity and natural beauty. Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious",

    "main_content": "Applying Design & Technology to Solve Real-Life Problems by Prakriti | Jan 4, 2022 This year (2021) in the Media, Communication and Technology domain, that starts from Grade 4, many of our learners focused on coding with the purpose of integrating the instruction with the physical objects, while others finessed their designs for making usable products. Learners from Grade 7 made circuit systems on security, parking or alarm systems while those from Grade 8 made Home Automation systems using Arduino. Examples are hand-sensing dustbins, water-sensing soil pots, intelligent-lighting systems and hand-sensing water dispensers. Grade 6 worked with mechanised controls and displayed remote controlled cars and contraptions. Grade 4 and 5 displayed electric mazes, sundials, electric wishing cards and scratch-programme games. 8E7ED7E2-AC6D-472C-8BCF-98061E0BEEC1C3635030-783C-40BB-BD88-401444597C791FF0B64A-36CA-4B81-B664-02557C1E214214EEB8BC-C3C4-4D64-8B0F-B24C1E8B0A3BBE9DB758-7339-4332-BB5A-B9EA4A6A24A548052F2F-BC95-455E-84AF-EC601C0B48F7F3338832-3240-46C6-8B10-4BA2EBFFB3C3\n\n\n\n--- Substack Article ---\nCan We Save the Planet or Should We Save Ourselves? Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts. Click here to read more about MannanA Campus Enriched by Nature's BountyOur landscape is a vibrant testament to our commitment to biodiversity and natural beauty. Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious",

Please read our frequently asked questions To register your child for admission to Prakriti, please fill the form using the “Register for admission” button on this page. Register for admission Frequently Asked Questions (with inputs from our parents) Prakriti Way of Learning How do you deliver experiential or deep learning? Sri Aurobindo had said, “nothing can be taught, it can only be learnt” and “learning goes from near to far”. Our education model revolves around facilitation and NOT teaching. Facilitation is a collaborative process where the teacher works together with the learners on developing experiences and curating resources so that the child is able to stretch beyond what he/she already knows to the zone of deep learning. Our facilitators are continuously researching and learning new ideas, teaching technologies as well as pedagogies. Examples of projects in Grade 4 can be found here. Some other key aspects of the learning programme at Prakriti are Connect with Nature and Socio-Emotional Learning. How do you impart Socio-Emotional Learning? From early years, we work on listening to ourselves, our inner being, as a habit. The learners have a circle time with the facilitators to talk freely about themselves, their peers as well as their immediate environment. Processes like developing rules for the classroom democratically, naming their group at the beginning of the year themselves are some of the ways through which we cultivate self-management and inner discipline. Prakriti children engage a lot in reflective writing and drawing to express their feelings. Older children meet with their facilitators in one-one sessions to express themselves openly and receive what their “didis” have to say. The school also provides proactive counselling to adolescents and parents. Is spirituality important to the School? Prakriti believes that India has a very rich heritage in Vedas, Buddha, Yoga and Vedanta that needs to be appreciated by the learners. We inculcate the sense of pride and imbibing the values through classroom discussions, readings, interactions with senior Hindu and Buddhist monks, celebrating secular festivals and chanting the Sanskrit hymns for the Divine power in all of us. Does the experiential learning methodology work in middle and senior grades? Absolutely. Experiential learning happens in a variety of forms. If it is by visualising, contextualising, touching, feeling and observing in early years, it is through enacting, reading stories in-context, going to factories and museums for enquiry and researching the topics for deep-learning. We have maker- and tinkering-labs for science experiments and creative modelling. Languages are taught in an inter-disciplinary way combining visual arts, theatre and literature. The approach works very well for deep learning in middle school. Cambridge (IGCSE) subjects lend themselves to enquiry and group projects in high school. What is the language of instruction and communication in school, especially in the early years? Does learning English late hamper their ability to interact in English? Prakriti is a bilingual school with English and Hindi as language of instruction in the early years. We start teaching Hindi formally in ages 3 and 4 and move to English reading and writing by age 4.5. Children who have a good command of the mother tongue are found to pick up multiple languages easily. In our experience, Prakriti learners are proficient in both English and Hindi, reading, writing and speaking, by the time they are 7, i.e, in Grade II. How many students are there per facilitator? There are around 12-15 learners per facilitator, which is a very healthy ratio. In early years (K-2), the learner-facilitator ratio is 7:1. We strongly believe in addressing the learning needs of each learner based on their interests, cultural background and prior knowledge. With a small class size, we are able to work on creating learning programmes that work for each child. How do you ensure one-on-one attention is being given to each student? We work with learners individually, in small groups. We develop learning goals (which includes, physical, emotional, core subjects and arts) for each child and work through the year in collaboration with the parents to track progress and reinforce learning at school and home. We have a practice of “bubble time” where a child can speak to the facilitator freely and vice-versa. We meet with each parent/family individually at least twice in a year over detailed meetings with all subject facilitators to discuss the observations about each learner. Low student ratio per class does give individual attention but does it promote healthy competition? Competition is usually within your own self; this requires the art and skill of deep self-reflection, a life skill that we develop in learners at Prakriti.. Competition with self and cooperation with others is the essence for bringing out the best in a child. We prepare our kids to face the real world. How do children learn arts and music in Prakriti? We have an all-year programme on Arts with quarterly modules on Theatre, Visual Arts, Music (vocals and instrumental) and Dance. All learners go through all the modules until they begin to specialise by Grade 8. Our Arts facilitators are highly qualified and specialised. For presentations, both in-school and external, a lot of times the children take the lead in planning and executing the program – they ideate, write, compose, edit – with the facilitators giving them ample support and direction, as required. What facilities do you have for sports? We have dedicated sports time every day for all classes. We emphasize on physical stamina and strength building through gymnastics, cycling and swimming for all ages. We have facilities for basketball, badminton, skateboarding, volleyball, table tennis, squash and football on campus. How do you assess academic skills? We begin formal graded examinations in Grade 9. Before that in Grades 6-8 we assess learners in a system of formative (feedback to the teacher) and summative (feedback to the learners) tests. Both of these tests are informal and are conducted within the regular school. We also assess children on aptitude in various subjects using a standardised test called ASSET, administered over 4,00,000 children across private and public schools in India. Would it be relevant to mention the ATS also here – its at a national level, and gives exposure to the children of an external examination set-up? We observe children round the year on socio-emotional skills, physical ability, learning styles and habits. Our annual report is quite rigorous and comprehensive where we include a child’s learning on holistics learning: emotional well-being social learning physical stamina and strength cognitive ability subject-specific learning, expression and learning styles We set the learning goals with the participation of the parents and maintain a living document that can be referenced for measuring progress. The year-end reports also present a plan for parents and teachers to work together to address the gaps and hone the strengths. How do Prakriti children fare in comparison with children from other schools? Learner-centered systems of education do not focus on competing with the peers or standardised metrics. Yet, as we follow the goals laid down by National Curriculum Framework in India (NCERT) and Cambridge International, our children are at the similar learning levels as their peers in other schools. They get there joyfully. School’s Mission With a restriction on student size how does it become feasible for a school to sustain itself? Deep learning cannot be facilitated in crowded classrooms. Having said that every school needs to sustain itself. We keep our overheads low and focus on having classrooms with very highly skilled facilitators. We have grown in the last nine years, organically, to be a K-12 school now. We are not focused on excess profits/surplus. How do you pitch yourself against more aggressive institutional power? We have not felt the need to pitch ourselves against institutional establishments. Our community, of parents and learners, is our biggest ambassador and it is the reason we have grown organically over the past three years. We are a self-funded organisation and thus not answerable to outside investors. We believe that our education programme differentiates us from other schools, in the minds of the new parents, and as such we don’t need to advertise. You have a fee structure comparable to established schools with various facilities. How do you justify it? We do not have any hidden charges for uniform, stationery, computers, projects etc. We are an Cambridge International school and have to uphold academic standards with rigour. We feel that our fee structure is well-justified by the low student to facilitator ratio and compassionate facilitators who are working with an individualised facilitation approach not didactic teaching. Prakriti is a green campus and ensures a healthy and natural environment, several field and farm trips in a year. We work not only with the children but also the parents with several group meetings with whole classroom parents, discussing the goals and learning approaches. All these features are part of Prakriti fee. Why don’t you believe in school uniforms? Does it not lead to differentiation in classrooms? Uniforms are required in industrial set-ups. Learners extend home learning to school when the enabling environment is kept the same. A school uniform also adds an extra and unnecessary financial burden on a family. We ensure that children wear normal and comfortable clothes and it doesn’t lead to differentiation. We discuss with the families wherever there is a deviation from this norm. Do you encourage competition? We encourage learners to compete with themselves. Each child participates in sports day and gets a medal, there are no differentiated medals. Formal grades are not awarded until Grade 9. We do not publish results of assessments to a group (or class). Individual reports are kept confidential and discussed only with the parents. What are the prospects after Prakriti, if a child is leaving before Grade 10? Do you find any gaps in Prakriti children’s learning? Our curriculum is aligned with the Cambridge curriculum as well as with the National Curriculum Framework set by NCERT so that the learners are achieving the baseline learning outcomes expected of them, when they move schools. In the past, the children who have moved out of Prakriti, have adjusted well in the mainstream schools. Measures of learning outcomes testing such as ASSET have reported above-average learning levels for most of our learners. See what parents say about this here: Affiliation Does Prakriti have any affiliation? We are affiliated to Cambridge Assessment International Education (CAIE). It is also known as International General Certificate for Secondary Education (IGCSE). We follow the learning outcomes defined by Cambridge while also meeting the goals set by National Curriculum Framework (NCF) in India. What is IGCSE or Cambridge affiliation? Over 10,000 schools in over 160 countries around the world offer Cambridge qualifications. CAIE is a division of Cambridge Assessment, a not-for-profit organisation and part of the world renowned University of Cambridge. Cambridge IGCSE is the world’s most popular international qualification for 14 to 16 year olds. It is taken in over 150 countries and in more than 4800 schools around the world. In India, here are about 400 schools that are affiliated with Cambridge. Why has Prakriti chosen Cambridge affiliation? We have chosen Cambridge over other boards because it offers freedom to learn in the way learners and teachers define together as the best way to learn rather than teaching to test. The learning outcomes defined by Cambridge are very well aligned with 21st Century skills for the learners- Critical Thinking, Communication, Collaboration and Creativity. Which degree/certificate will the children have in Class 12? We will offer International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP), offered by IB, Geneva. IBDP is the most popular high school degree programme. Is Cambridge/IBDP acceptable by Indian Universities? Yes. Most public and private universities accept Cambrirdge and IBDP certificates. In fact, Association of Indian Universities, https://www.aiu.ac.in/, set up by the UGC Act provides an equivalent certificate for use by national universities, if the child has an international degree or diploma such as IGCSE A Levels or IBDP. What are the prospects after Grade 12 for an International Certificate? A child from Prakriti would integrate into any other school as easily as they would from any other school. There have been some children who have needed to move out from Grades 1-5 and have adjusted well at other mainstream schools. Grade 10 and 12 students will have internationally and nationally recognized degree certificates to be accepted in any system. Teachers What kind of teachers do you hire? We hire multi-discipline qualified teachers with learner-empathy, research-orientation and respectful communication as the most important skill sets over experience or academic background. All teachers, cleaning and security staff are called didi-bhaiya to develop familial affinity with the children and to signal lack of special status to any profession. In middle school, our facilitator pool has significant non-teaching experience to offer diversity and real-world experience. Our current classrooms have a biochemist teaching Natural Sciences, a Hindi Theatre artist and language expert teaching Hindi and an English litterateur and Pali language scholar teaching English. In primary and early years programmes, our teachers have progressive education gathered within Prakriti or schools like Mirambika/Azim Premji University. Freshers from B.El.Ed. programme of Delhi University join us every year and undergo a year of on the job training. How do you motivate and retain your teachers? We build a culture of respectful communication, personal and professional growth for our facilitators. In a joyful, small-classroom learning environment with experiential curriculum, facilitators teach and learn as well. We mentor our facilitators continuously in a structure of professional mentors/researchers assisting the teachers with planning, delivering and assessing the learning outcomes. Founders of the school are directly involved with mentoring the teachers themselves. Learners with Special Needs How do you support learners with special needs? We have a well-established “Bridge” programme with a team of 45 special educators who work with learners with various physical and learning disabilities and special needs. Our counsellors are trained in identifying these needs and working with parents and facilitators to develop modifications and accommodations in curriculum and assessments. We create Individual Education Plans (IEPs) in the beginning of the year in collaboration with the special educators and the parents. We have special educators who work with specific needs such as ADHD, ASD, Dyslexia/Dyscalculia and emotional needs such as anxiety disorders. Does integration of special needs children in classes not create a bias in the minds of “normal” children? Does it not get disruptive? No. We integrate a small number in every class. Typically, the mild learning disabilities are supported by the teachers in the classroom through modifications and accommodations for such learners. Severe disabilities are handled by shadow facilitators who are always present with the children in the classroom. We reinforce our culture of appreciating differences and valuing classroom equity throughout the year. We find that the students’ own learning and their world-view changes in a diverse classroom.\n\n\n\n--- Substack Article ---\nCan We Save the Planet or Should We Save Ourselves? Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts. Click here to read more about MannanA Campus Enriched by Nature's BountyOur landscape is a vibrant testament to our commitment to biodiversity and natural beauty. Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious",

As an immersive workshop before starting the coursework, they worked on an automated hand sanitiser prototype. Learners were given the brief to research, design and manufacture a prototype hand sanitiser dispenser for a user of their choice in the style of an existing designer. The project aimed to introduce learners to design and technology by merging graphic design and systems and control disciplines. The research involved analysing existing dispensers, creating a designer moodboard and interviewing a user. Learners were inspired by designers including Gerrit Rietveld and Louis Comfort Tiffany. Through the analysis and user interviews, learners decided how their dispenser should work. They created flow diagrams to understand the workings of automatic hand sanitiser dispensers using sensors. Some groups opted to use Arduino kits to program and create a touchless dispenser and other groups opted to use a switch connected to a motor and battery. Using what they learnt in their research, learners sketched designs and worked in groups or independently to make their prototypes. They used corrugated cardboard to make the structure before installing the sanitiser dispenser mechanisms. The next step in the design process would be to test and evaluate their products, gather user feedback and plan refinements.\n\n--- Extended Article Content ---\nIGCSE (Cambridge Grade X) Results 2022-23 by Prakriti | Jan 18, 2023 Cambridge announced the IGCSE results for June series on 14th August 2023.

This was a speaking-listening event with an intent to initiate dialogue among students and to bring into focus the qualities of ‘listening’ and ‘working together’. It spanned 45 days with three 15 day slots. Every fortnight the participants received a batch of articles on philosophy, scientific research and reportage which they were expected to read and then respond to questions on a special Google Classroom created for the purpose. The articles ranged from relationships with the digital world, to education and interpersonal relationships. After the last fortnight, they came to Prakriti on the 20th. At Prakriti they were seated in a circle and the following challenge statement was given to them to decipher and understand. “A human being, is a mass of accumulated knowledge and reactions according to that knowledge. Computers and Artificial Intelligence are taking charge of all that. It is happening. Now, the brain is being exercised through pain, through pleasure, through suffering, anxiety, all the rest of it. But it is working. And when the computers and AI take over, it will cease to work. And if it is not working, it will deteriorate; it is because we have problems, it acts.” They discussed and debated for close to three hours at the end of which they were expected to present a ‘Document of Understanding’ which reflected the common understanding of the group. However, to exert the participants a bit so as they move beyond their comfort zone of offering opinions and judgments about the statement, certain rules were laid out. These included, they could neither agree or disagree with the statement, they had to listen to each speaker and could not cross-talk and they did not have to propose any solutions to the problem (if at all any) the statement was pointing out. All they had to do was to decode the true meaning of the statement in all its complexity. As the discussions unfolded, the meaning of the statement was revised again and again and previous understandings questioned, challenged, dropped and picked up again. There was lively debate and each participant seemed to be deeply immersed in the process of understanding the statement with others. This state of engagement is what is often recognized as deep thinking or critical thinking or constructive dialogue. It was in this space that it appeared that they were no longer worried about agreeing or disagreeing with each other, but actually engaging with the statement and attempting to understand what it meant. Here are some statements from their final ‘Document of Understanding’ which we felt were very insightful and although seemingly simple, hold deep treasures: “Humans have a desperate, constant need to advance. They have a drive or ambition that Ais cannot quash. The human brain will always look for more problems to solve.” “Humans are more than just reactions and emotions.” “AI is a mass of algorithm, data driven knowledge, and reactions according to that knowledge.” “Humans are dependent on AI to a certain extent, whereas, AI is fully dependent on humans.” “If the human mind is not faced with challenges and situations constantly, it will deteriorate; it is because we want to create and evolve, it acts.” Here are some photographs and videos from the event:\n\n--- Extended Article Content ---\nLaunching New AS/A Level and IGCSE Subjects by Prakriti | Mar 5, 2023 Last year, we delivered on our expanded IGCSE subject offering.

Over 10,000 schools in over 160 countries around the world offer Cambridge qualifications. CAIE is a division of Cambridge Assessment, a not-for-profit organisation and part of the world renowned University of Cambridge. Cambridge IGCSE is the world’s most popular international qualification for 14 to 16 year olds. It is taken in over 150 countries and in more than 4800 schools around the world. In India there are about 400 schools that are affiliated with Cambridge. As part of the affiliation process, Cambridge Approval Visit was planned for the first week of August after clearing the basic regulatory milestones. The visit by the officials of the Cambridge Assessment International Examination (a part of the University of Cambridge and the body which conducts the IGCSE exam) required the school to put together years of work to establish our commitment to learning in a globally connected way. All facilitators actively participated and presented to the Cambridge team. We have chosen Cambridge over other boards because it offers freedom to learn in the way learners and teachers define together as the best way to learn rather than teaching to test. The learning outcomes defined by Cambridge are very well aligned with 21st Century skills for the learners – Critical Thinking, Communication, Collaboration and Creativity. Cambridge Assessment International Education prepares school students for life, helping them develop an informed curiosity and a lasting passion for learning. It is part of the University of Cambridge. Cambridge Pathway gives students a clear path for educational success from age 5 to 19. Reasons for the Cambridge Pathway: Success : Cambridge Pathway gives students a clear path for educational success from age 5 to 19. Flexibility: Schools can shape the curriculum around how they want students to learn – with a wide range of subjects and flexible ways to offer them. Future Skills: Help students discover new abilities and a wider world, and develop the skills they need for life, so they can achieve at school, university and work. Development: Each stage builds on learners’ development in the previous stage, or from other education systems. Choice: Offer an unrivalled choice of subjects: over 70 at Cambridge IGCSE and over 50 at Cambridge International AS & A Level. Students can choose subjects in any combination. Recognition: Qualifications are recognised by universities worldwide, including over 650 in the US. Preparation: 98% of admissions officers surveyed said Cambridge programmes give students excellent preparation for university. Training: Cambridge International provides first-class support for teachers through publications, online resources, training and professional development. Global: Every year, Cambridge learners from 10000 schools in over 160 countries prepare for their future with an education from Cambridge International. Heritage: Cambridge International has a 150-year history of providing international exams. It is also a not-for-profit organisation and part of the University of Cambridge. Cambridge Pathway: The four stages of Cambridge Pathway lead seamlessly from primary to secondary and pre-university years. Each stage – Cambridge Primary, Cambridge Lower Secondary, Cambridge Upper Secondary and Cambridge Advanced – builds on the learners’ development from the previous one, but can also be offered separately.\n\n--- Extended Article Content ---\nPrakriti’s Views on NEP Released by Prakriti | Sep 3, 2020 Our School Director, Shilpa Tayal, recently expressed her views on National Education Policy 2020 in a panel discussion with Ms Venita Kaul, former HoD, NCERT (ECCE), hosted by Headword Publishing and explained how the school has been practising the essence of what NEP has advocated. National Education Policy is a much-needed reform and an uphill implementation task. Rightly so, the policy emphasizes on including Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) in the purview of public schooling and improving the curriculum of it. The policy also emphasizes on strengthening literacy and numeracy in primary years as well as relieving children from the stress of examination in high school and beyond by suggesting rolling examination. Holistic learning, flexible streams and inter-disciplinary learning are some of the buzzwords used in the policy as well. Literacy & Numeracy We believe that literacy and numeracy skills can be built through methods that are play-based, experiential or in-context academic work. The goals of NEP can also not be achieved in crowded classrooms. The public (and private) schools need teachers who are able to focus on social-emotional needs as well as personalise the instruction with the right tools. The task is not easy as the first three years of learning get included in the state education system for the first time and needs significant capacity building in teachers. Early Childhood Care & Development A good ECCE programme has lots of physical activity, tactile and sensorial play-based learning supported by music and art. In early primary years (grades 1 & 2), interest in reading and writing needs to be developed by working in context of children, their immediate surroundings, homes and families. At Prakriti, young learners express their thoughts and feelings about their environment through words, poems and songs. We use the learning corners in the classrooms for language cards and games. In the senior primary years, the learners develop their own literature, identity texts and engage in daily reflective writing. We teach numbers and basic operations using objects. Our learners develop shapes and patterns to understand spatial mathematics. Medium of Instruction We are a bilingual school and recommend to families in early years to encourage the use of mother tongue. Global research in child development tells us that learners well-versed with their mother tongue are cognitively better placed to learn a foreign language compared to those who are not. Student-Centred, Flexible and Inter-disciplinary Curriculum At Prakriti, we have a practice of collaborating with our learners and parents every year to set up learning goals for the year. Our curriculum is dynamic, reflecting the classroom requirements from year to year, considering the skills and interests of the learners. We have aligned ourselves to IGCSE as we appreciate the liberal subject choices, pedagogic styles and the assessment freedom it provides. Prakriti way of learning is significantly inter-disciplinary, as recommended by NEP. Art is well inter-twined into language learning as the learner routinely express their emotion upon reading texts through art. Outdoor experience is usually integrated with study of Sciences, Social Sciences and Environment, read our previous blog Competency Development & Assessment NEP opens great opportunities for Public-Private Partnerships. It is a golden chance for the government to facilitate universal quality education from early years to grade 12 by creating clusters of competence and technology-based teacher-training. It has introduced the concept of rolling examination to ease the high school students of exam-pressure but has added informal examination in Grades 3-5 for testing literacy and numeracy. Implemented well, formative assessments can go a long way in providing feedback to the teachers. NEP talks about the flexibility and student choice in streams of learning. This is a much needed intervention for schools and parents who were extremely focused on delineating streams to maximise chances of success in undergraduate college entrance. At the core of it, implementing the pedagogic reform under NEP requires child-centered schools, where class sizes or “scale” is not a parameter for school success, happiness of learners is.\n\n--- Extended Article Content ---\nInteractive Session with Earth Scientist at NASA | Sep-11 by Prakriti | Sep 1, 2020 Prakriti had invited Ms. Sandra Cauffman, who currently serves as the Deputy Director of the Earth Science Division in the Science Mission Directorate (SMD) at NASA Headquarters. She previously served as the Acting Division Director, where she provided executive leadership, strategic direction, and overall management for the entire agency’s Earth Science portfolio, from technology development, applied science, research, mission implementation and operation. Ms. Cauffman shared her life experiences, her journey to NASA along with takeaways from NASA mission with our young learners of Grade 5, 6 and 7. The event was open to all including students of other schools. She enlightened our learners about Mars mission (MAVEN and PERSEVERANCE), Deep Space Missions and other NASA Missions along with NASA’s collaboration with ISRO for the NISAR Mission. She introduced them to the fact that “being an astronaut isn’t the only career in Space Science”. They got to know about opportunities available in space related fields and pathways to follow to join the space organisations. This event was open to parents and adult learning community of Prakriti School to watch live on our FB page. The event was scheduled on September 11, 2020 at 4:30 PM IST\n\n--- Extended Article Content ---\nPrakriti learner-musicians at Itihaas Anveshan Finals by Prakriti | Oct 17, 2020 The team of young Prakriti learners competed with 500 teams of adults and peers all over India to get to the finals at “ITIHAAS ANVESHAN ONLINE“.

It is the time for the schools to up the game from experiential learning or projects to Project-based learning in its true essence. At Prakriti, we have started the practice of Personal Projects for all our grades to elevate the co-creation of knowledge and use personal passions to develop skills for active learning. Project-Based Learning Project-based learning (PBL) is a student-centred pedagogy that involves a dynamic classroom approach in which it is believed that students acquire a deeper knowledge through active exploration of real-world challenges and problems. In the traditional teaching method, projects are assigned to the students at the end of the semester which are largely illustrative or a model of something previously learned. While PBL is essentially research-based and demands investigation, the gathering of information, and integration rather than falling onto the preexisting set of knowledge.By definition, project-based learning entails a pragmatic approach to a real-life situation through a well-thought-out suitable plan specially designed to solve a specific problem. In case it deflects from the expected path, it is analyzed and the individual forges ahead with the revised method. Personal Projects @Prakriti Purpose of a personal project is to build an ecosystem for the child for independent learning. As we know that learning is most joyful when it is aligned with the interests of the child. As adults some of us are clear about our passions today but for some who are not, they are advised to go back to their childhood days and remember and think about what they enjoyed the most. Thus, the purity of childhood is the best time to explore one’s passions. Personal project is also an opportunity for the children to know themselves- to explore what they enjoy doing. For some children it could be furthering what their known interests are and while for others it could be something they are curious about and want to build their knowledge on. Project Discovery The learners have been asked to think of topics or research questions for their personal projects and mentors would facilitate a process of self-discovery by asking them the following fundamental questions. 1. Why is the idea personal to you?The idea should be something that the learner is deeply motivated about. 2. What is the challenge in this idea?The project should be that which requires significant effort in achieving from where the learner is today. It is a stretch goal. 3. How will you go about learning in this project?There should be a plan such as consulting people, reading resources or visiting places for gaining information or learning a skill for mastery. 4. How will you demonstrate your learning?There should be a plan to showcase learning by way of a presentation of learning of a product or a piece of writing say, or even a demonstration of dance where the process of learning can be journaled and presented. Self reflection The ultimate objective of a personal project is to develop meta-cognition skills. The learnersshould be able to reflect their ability to learn independently, managing time, overcoming difficulties and collaborating with the mentor. Samples of Personal Projects Our learners are building “products” or shared knowledge on myriad topics that are all unique, connect with them deeply and useful for the society. Examples are: Developing a website to learn western music composition and instrumental music Writing a drama script from Greek Mythology Profiling the techniques of warfare at Maratha, Mughal and British forces Developing simple robots for helping in daily work Learning to make local food to preserve family heritage Understanding the inspiration of gaming entrepreneurs in Japan…and many more… 'Happy' Played by Madhav Training Lio Creating Robot\n\n--- Extended Article Content ---\nWhat can Modern Schools Learn from Ancient Wisdom? by Prakriti | Aug 7, 2021 “Ancient Indian traditions may say a lot to modern schools. Only if the schools are willing to listen….” Once upon a time, there lived a frog who had spent all his life in a well. One day, another frog from the ocean came to its well. The frog from the well started jumping around from one corner of the well to another, boasting of its vastness. For the ocean frog, the well was a joke compared to the ocean. It irked the well frog and it forced its guest out of the well, forever! This is a story by Swami Ramkrishna Paramhansa. Modern learning is making us the ‘frog from the well’. It proclaims to be ‘open’ and ‘inter-disciplinary’ and yet fears the inclusion of ‘religion’ and ‘philosophy’ which form the core base of learning. Modern learning is ironic. It aims to make changes in a system without understanding it from ‘inside-out’. It will find something and put it to action with no long-term vision. ‘Curiosity makes us grow; eagerness can kill!’. If this is not the case, then why are we tracing our ways back to old times and practices? To name a few – Ayurveda, organic farming, yoga, meditation, and the list can go on. There is not one sphere of life that is not covered in the great Vedas, Upanishads, and Vedanta. That was learning in its true form – OBSERVE, INSTILL, ASSIMILATE, PROCESS, UNDERSTAND and one will LEARN instinctively! Changing education from many foreign invasions, especially by Mughals and Britishers, changed the perception of learning. In ancient India, the ideal of life was spiritualistic. So, the aim was attainment of ‘Brahma’ or self-realization. In ancient Sparta education was socialistic, and not individualistic. It aimed at producing courageous soldiers. The Romans had a materialistic outlook. The Middle Ages saw education as a priestly affair – formal in character and religious in outlook. By the twentieth century, education became industrialized with the purpose of contributing to human welfare and progress. The aftermath of these changes – losing the true meaning of learning. Glimpse into Ancient Wisdom The aim of Vedic education was not merely limited to acquisition of knowledge but “development of character” based on the principles of ‘Dharma’. It involved multidimensional approach —- development of moral conscience, personality (self-esteem, self-confidence, self-restraint and self-respect), civic responsibilities and social values, infusion of spiritual and religious values, ethical training, preserving and diffusing national culture, problem solving techniques with ease and calm mind, sharpening intellect and memory, research and development, management as a science, practical education, and achieving enlightenment. The traditional methods of learning had a holistic approach. They did not categorize everything into boxes of analytical, logical, emotional, social, physical, and psychological. Rather, they treated these as a unit which must function together. Vedic education comprised three processes: Sravana (listen and understand), Manana (reflect), and Nididhyaana (complete comprehension by realization and experience) – simple but effective techniques. It was done under a residential schooling system called ‘Gurukul’ where the guru (teacher who also acted as a father-figure) and his shishyas (students) lived a life of ‘Simple Living and High Thinking’. They studied, and developed holistically and spiritually. Parishads (comparable to modern day universities) such as Takshshila, Nalanda, Kashi, Valabhi, Vikramshila, Kanchi, Odantapuri and Jagaddala, to name a few mammoth institutions, attracted learners from all parts of the globe. Sammelans (gatherings) held discussions and competitions among the most learned scholars in the country. The education of Vedas, Upanishads, and Vedangas was not merely religious. It encompassed a range of subjects —- political science, economics, metallurgy, medicinal science, surgery, space research of planets and galaxies, cosmology, astrology, nuclear physics, energy concepts, thermodynamics, environmental management, phonetics, ritualistic knowledge, grammar, metrics, exegetics (science of interpretation), philosophy, warfare, music, dancing, painting, agriculture, investigation, and many more! Acharya Chanakya in his books Kautilya’s Arthashastra and Chanakya Niti documented political and economic management philosophies and strategies. He brought all the separate kingdoms together in India under a central governance – nation called ‘Aryavartha’. It was the first time in human history to ever see a mention of ‘nation’. For centuries, his strategies have been used worldwide to build a nation with sound economics based on spirituality. A comparable quality of iron used in the Iron Pillar of Delhi can not be replicated by the modern metallurgists. It is the largest hand-forged block of iron from days of yore. The description of advanced scientific techniques in the Vedic literature is far more superior than those of the modern technological world. Seeking answers from Ancient Wisdom In the current global scenario, fear in multiple forms is instilled into our brain. Indiscipline, corruption, crimes, and inhuman behaviour are a product of ‘modified learning in factories called modern schools promoting the rat race to be ahead of others’. The pandemic has questioned the ’modern happiness and understanding’. People are becoming insecure. Paul Bloom, a psychology professor at Yale, explains the rhetoric of white supremacy. He explains their slogan “You will not replace us” as a chant of worried people to people they think are a threat to their status and way of life. An unethical man is as good as dead. And unaware, we have become unethical in our mysterious ways. The answer to all these problems can be traced back to ancient wisdom. Natural Learning Traditional methods believed in the natural and unique rhythm of a child for learning from a ‘mixed age community’ in a conducive environment close to Mother Nature with no predisposition to ‘scientific data’, ‘subjects’ and ‘definitive normalcy’. They allowed freedom and hence, learning was at its best. All the major discoveries and inventions were made because the discoverers and inventors were free — free from the boxes of preconceived notions. The fun of learning lies in being wild and not in being tamed. “Everybody has a sense of music in them but not all of us can play a harp”. The current education system of making everybody learn the same things in the same way, at the same pace, in the adult-directed environment of same-age people with the same objective is ignorant in the first place. Ironic enough, this same ‘ignorant education system’ teaches – “Ignorance kills Learning”. Democratic Learning “A civilization is not built of bricks, steel and machinery, it is built with men, their quality and character.” – Dr. Radhakrishnan Traditional education had realized men as social beings. It emphasized on social duties equally. The shishyas were made aware of their duties outside the walls of Gurukul including the importance of being a good child, spouse, parent and citizen of the nation. They honored the code of all the professions. Equality was fostered by providing the same simple living conditions and everyone doing all the basic chores such as cleaning, cooking, and others. Women during Vedic and Upanishadic age enjoyed equal rights in education as men. They were honored and respected in society. The girls were literate in a variety of subjects – religion, literature, dance, music, and other fine arts. Many ‘Sanhitas’ of Rig Veda were composed by women. There were not just Rishis but Rishikas, and not just Gurus but Gurvis. Experiential and Interest-led Learning “Experience is a hard teacher because she gives the test first, the lesson afterward.” – Swami Vivekananda People are told to learn from their ‘experiences’. In a robotic world of ‘do(s) and don’t(s)’, it becomes hard to truly experience things. In the journey of ‘You should be this’, one loses the fun experience of ‘I could have been this’. Traditional methods focussed majorly on ‘inner experience’ – living experience from inside to unfold the metaphysical truths of nature. Self-experience was considered as true learning. The effectiveness of the methodology can be realized from the attraction of so many quantum physicists from around the world to the Vedas in India – Quantum Physics being one of the highest and most researched fields in Science. One of the brightest minds on Earth to ever live, Albert Einstein, once said “We owe a lot to the Indians, who taught us how to count, without which no worthwhile scientific discovery would have been made”. So how do we bring this Ancient Wisdom into our schools? Modern schools have to bring multiple reforms in their approach to revive learning. They have a broader role in cutting the clutter of packing too many things in a child’s schedule and employing natural, democratic, and experiential and interest-led learning. The Aryasamaj Gurukul, the Sanatan Dharma Rishikula, and the Santiniketan School have stood as prominent examples of modern institutions at successfully attempting a revival of Ancient Wisdom in the present age. Modern schools such as Isha Home School, Rishi Valley, Mirambika and Prakriti have espoused some of the ancient wisdom in the way they teach. Some of the ways of achieving these three major zones of learning, inspired from traditional methodology, are: * The modern infrastructure should be conducive and close to Mother Nature for students to experience mindfulness. The educators must have faith in the child’s natural rhythm. By embracing joy and curiosity, learning will become a life-long process. Encouraging mixed-age learning is important for the overall growth and development of a child. Following Guru-Shishya Parampara will develop a natural feeling of respect for elders and others in the society. Activities, training workshops and other methods can be employed to develop a bond of security and trust between teacher and student. The pressurizing ‘rank-based’ system driven by academic performance must be replaced with a ‘value-based’ system driven by a perfect combination of academics and extracurricular activities to promote the uniqueness of a child and make them better individuals. * Socialization of individuals through education is important for passing down the democratic ideals to the society. The students’ learning must be aimed at contributing to the community. The qualities of scientific temperament of mind, tolerance, brotherhood, cooperation, sympathy, empathy, discipline, standing up for social justice, and discipline must be developed. The schools should provide administrative support and community connections for professional development. This can be achieved through resource allocation and goal-setting with expected outcomes. * The learning must be encouraged through self-experience and an interest-led approach. Rote learning and a rigidly defined-curriculum should be discouraged. Children should be helped to develop the skill of meta-cognition, i.e., “how do they know what they know”. Learning should be inter-disciplinary with art, music, theatre, all integral parts of ancient knowledge in India, should be well-integrated into the learning domains of languages, math, and sciences. At the core, it begins with inculcating love for India’s history and source of knowledge and discoveries to the rest of the world. The Advancement It has been centuries since the Britishers have destroyed our culture and Science. The majority of Indians still see the ‘problems’ in us as a nation which has always stood the test of time. Understanding and learning from ‘Abrahamic Lens’ is not going to help the cause. Unfortunately, modern schools have blindly followed the same path. At this point, it is not likely to completely revert to the traditional age of Vedas, Upanishads and Vedanta. Yet, inculcating the learning, approach, and methods from them into the modern system will aid in getting back on the path to true learning. ‘Religion and God’ should not be seen as abstract anymore, but rather as pure science. We already have a dormant form of everything within us. Take a few steps back and find the ‘lost Science’ preserved in our vibrant and glorious ancient culture. This Science does not ask to cut things to the core to learn. It makes us learn things by building up. It is based upon the philosophy of life. ‘Learning from it will show us the way to life’. “Like fire in a piece of flint, knowledge exists in mind. Suggestion is the friction which brings it out.” – Swami Vivekananda About the author: Shreya is a writing enthusiast and an educator. She holds a Master’s in Biology from University of Delhi.\n\n--- Extended Article Content ---\nRemembering Danish Siddiqui by Prakriti | Jul 18, 2021 Danish Siddiqui, father of one of the children at Prakriti and a world-acclaimed photo-journalist is no more today. However, his relentless quest for exposing the truth to raise consciousness of the society will keep him alive with us eternally. He will be a role model of truth seeking, courage and risk-taking for learners, teachers and student activists at Prakriti and other places of education. His soul-stirring photographs will continue to inspire many for purposeful journalism. As a loving father, Danish still made time for a few of the physical events that happened at school during the lockdown. His search for progressive education had brought the family to Prakriti. He had a deep interest in inculcating the connect with the heritage and deep-rooted values of India in his children. Prakriti Learners, parents and facilitators can express their tribute to Danish bhaiya in the school-wide prayer meeting on Wednesday, 21 July at 5PM. May his onward journey be peaceful. May there be peace in the world.\n\n--- Extended Article Content ---\nSelf-directed Learning through Personal Projects by Prakriti | Dec 15, 2021 Self-directed Learning, a form of learning, where learners are in the driver seat of their own learning, has been seen to deliver great results for the educators, who around the world, are researching and deploying strategies that engage classrooms deeply. During self-directed learning, learners learn independently, setting their own goals and evaluating on their own during the course of learning. Experiential learning, a more commonly understood approach by the educators, refers to conscious events and perceptions, leading to practical knowledge and familiarity through observations. It focuses on an individual’s learning process and aims at development of skills – such as memory, creativity, and sensitivity – to achieve knowledge. There are various approaches to experiential learning, one of which is project based learning. Self-directed learning combined with experiential learning gives rise to Personal Projects as a learning tool. At Prakriti, learners get the opportunity to explore a topic of their individual liking by means of a personal project. Glimpses of their project presentations are captured here: https://prakriti.edu.in/personal-projects/ https://prakriti.edu.in/wp-content/uploads/Personal-Projects-_-The-Video1.mp4 The purpose is to build an ecosystem for independent thinking and learning. For some it could be furthering their known areas of interests, while for others it could be searching for and discovering what triggers them on. While the topic and execution is entirely driven by the learner, mentors facilitate this process of self-discovery. In a broader perspective, a personal project aims at developing meta-cognition skills, ie, awareness and understanding of one’s own thought processes. The learners should be able to reflect upon their ability to learn independently, manage time, overcome difficulties and collaborate with the mentor. Learners, Grades 4 onward have been involved in personal projects this year at Prakriti. Here, each learner chose a topic of his/her interest and developed into a project. Projects ranged from research reports, to practically building things, to conducting workshops. Children chose topics as diverse as studying how ships work, researching about the origins of Puranas (ancient scriptures), learning to do digital art, to building a firewood oven (and baking pizza in it). We are updating our website with video presentations of the learners’ projects: https://prakriti.edu.in/personal-projects/ The core idea of personal project based learning is to connect learners’ experiences with academics and to give then agency over learning concepts and skills that transfer to other domains of learning. Learners benefit from discoveries and experiments, while exploring personal and others’ real world experiences at the same time. Here, the teacher works like a sounding board and not a facilitator, mentoring the learner with thought-provoking questions and ideas. Learning focuses not just on cognitive progress, but also on social and emotional growth – which could be at least, if not more, important. This approach calls for a deeper understanding of the problem through ownership and concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract conceptualization and active experimentation , refer to David Kolb’s model to know more. In this blog, we’re discussing a few of the projects to understand how this approach brought the best out of these 8-13 year olds. In this first edition, we have provided glimpses into a few projects from our middle school. Experience the learner journeys on developing characters, a game, skilling as a barista and being a blogger with book reviews.\n\n--- Extended Article Content ---\nIn-building diversity through teams by Prakriti | Dec 12, 2021 As we expand our new campus, more hands join us aboard to create a conducive environment that would augment and edify the growth of our learners’.

Here are few glimpses from our celebration. Red Group (Pre-Nursery) 'Ganesh Vandana' Starting with Red Group, our youngest learners who are three (3) years old, performed ‘Ganesh Vanadana’. In the Truth and Courage celebration, learners are guided to perform their acts of courage on an aspect that’s untried before as a group and create a symphony with their peers. Sunrise Group (Grade 6) 'Mahishasur Mardini Strotam' Devotional stotra of Goddess Durga ‘Mahisasur Mardini’ written by Guru Adi Sankaracharya was recited and sang by learners of Sunrise Group together. Luminosity Group (Grade 6) 'Kathputli Ka Raja' दीपावली के विशेष अवसर पर ‘ ट्रुथ एंड करेज प्रोग्राम ‘ के तहत कक्षा छ: लुमिनोसिटी ग्रुप के छात्रों ने ‘ कठपुतली का राजा ‘ नामक नाटक की प्रस्तुति तैयार की जिसकी मूलसंवेदना है कठिन समय में बैर-भाव को दूर करते हुए मदद करना। इसे कठपुतलियों के अभिनय के द्वारा, कविता और संवादों के माध्यम से दर्शाया गया है। नाटक में दो राजाओं के बीच जंग होने वाली है। दोनों राजाओं को जंग पर जाना है। एक राजा योध्दाओं वाले कपड़े पहने हुए , अपनी तलवार, ढाल और भाला लेकर मैदान में आता है तथा दूसरा राजा जो हर अवसर पर सज-संवरकर के रहना पसंद करता है, भले ही जंग लड़ने क्यों न जाने हो ? और जंग लड़ने के लिए तलवार और ढाल की जगह शीशा ले जाता है तो क्या होता होगा ? दुश्मन राजा से कैसे सामना करता होगा ? जब कोई संकट आता होगा तो उसका उपाय कैसे निकालता होगा ? इन्हीं सब घटनाओं को लुमिनोसिटी ग्रुप के छात्रों ने बड़े ही रोचक तरीके से दिखाया है। Unity Group (Grade 7) 'Inter-Being' by Thich Nhat Hanh “Emptiness does not mean nothingness. Saying that we are empty does not mean that we do not exist. No matter if something is full or empty, that thing clearly needs to be there in the first place. When we say a cup is empty, the cup must be there in order to be empty. When we say that we are empty, it means that we must be there in order to be empty of a permanent, separate self. About thirty years ago I was looking for an English word to describe our deep interconnection with everything else. I liked the word “togetherness,” but I finally came up with the word “interbeing.” The verb “to be” can be misleading, because we cannot be by ourselves, alone. “To be” is always to “inter-be.” If we combine the prefix “inter” with the verb “to be,” we have a new verb, “inter-be.” To inter-be and the action of interbeing reflects reality more accurately. We inter-are with one another and with all life.” Thich Nhat Hanh Integrity Group (Grade 3) 'Anandaloke Mangalaloke' Anandaloke Mangaloke, a song composed by Rabindranath Tagore for expressing devotion to the divine. An English translation of the song is as follows: In this world of bliss, as the light of blessing, Thou dost reign, O Glory and Truth. Thy majestic splendour Sets alight the firmament, All the sparkling jewel worlds Lie circled at Thy feet. Planets, stars, moon and sun, Yearning, spinning swiftly, Imbibe thy radiance, Immersed in Thy eternal rays. Honeyed showers of ceaseless beauty Charm and bless the Earth In flower and leaf, in symphony, Aroma, glowing colour. Day and night the stream of life Surges ever fresh Through life and death, incessant flows Thy benevolent grace. Caring, kindness, love, devotion, Mellow and soothe the soul. What bounteous solace Thou dost pour To wash away all pain. With pomp and celebration The universe adores Thee. Wondrous bounty! O Almighty! Fearless Sanctuary! Honesty Group (Grade 5) 'Dastangoi' कहानी कहने के तमाम तरह की विधाएं विकसित हुई हैं, उन्हीं में से ‘ दास्तानगोई ‘ 13 वीं शताब्दी की उर्दू मौखिक कहानी कला का कलात्मक रूप है जिसमें मंच के केंद्र में कहानी कहने वाला कलाकार होता है जिसे ‘ दास्तानगो ‘ कहा जाता है। दास्तानगो एक ही जगह बैठे हुए अपने चेहरे की भाव-भंगगिमाओं और आवाज़ के जादू से कहानी कहता है। कक्षा पाँच के होनेस्टी ग्रुप ने ‘ दास्तानगोई ‘ विधा के ज़रिए कहानी ‘ अबू खां की बकरी ‘ को प्रस्तुत किया है जिसमें बताया गया कि जब हमारे सामने कोई बड़ा संकट आ जाता है तो हिम्मत और समझदारी से किस तरह से काम लेना चाहिए ? संकट चाहे जितना बड़ा हो, इंसान के साहस से बड़ा नहीं होता है। धैर्य और समझदारी से सोचने पर सारे रास्ते नज़र आने लगते हैं। यह कहानी एक ऐसी ही बकरी चांदनी की है जिसे पहाड़ों की खुली हवा पसंद है, खेलना-कूदना उसे भाता है और इसी चक्कर में एक दिन मुसीबत में पड़ जाती है क्योंकि उसके सामने भेड़िया आ जाता है तो ऐसे में क्या चांदनी यह मान ले कि उसके पास बचकर निकलने का कोई तरीका नहीं है ? या अपनी समझ बूझ से चांदनी अपने आप को बचा ले जाए ? तो आइए सुनते हैं कक्षा पाँच के होनेस्टी ग्रुप द्वारा तैयार की गई ‘ दास्तानगोई ‘ :-\n\n--- Extended Article Content ---\nPrakriti Learners Winners of ITIHAAS Anveshan 2020 by Prakriti | Nov 3, 2020 The team of young Prakriti learners competed with 100 school teams in the finals at the music competition “ITIHAAS ANVESHAN ONLINE“, with their original composition.

The project began with a small activity where few statements were given to the students about themselves and few movements were attached to it. They were supposed to do that movement if that statement was correct for them, for example-: Turn around if you like Broccoli Tickle your palm if you have a brother Make a weird face if you like to swim Shake your hands if you are afraid of dogs, etc. This activity became a warm up as well as a hint for students about what we’ll do in the class and what would be the focus of the class. Then in the class itself we did a worksheet on “What I like to” so this had 4 questions-: What I like to eat and why What I like to wear and why What I like to do and why What I like to play with and why These specific questions were given to students as at age 6-7 if we ask them to write about themselves then that becomes too abstract for them. Therefore, to bring their thought process to themselves and to let them think what actually belongs to them or what are their likes and dislikes, these specific questions were taken. Gradually we moved ahead with concrete things. It was a stupendous journey! Children came out with great writings and thoughts. When the students were given the worksheet on “what I like to and why” we got amazing answers from them. Apart from self awareness reasoning skills were also getting worked on. Then we moved ahead with asking students about their “favourite fruit” and few questions were attached in the instructions like-: Why do you like this fruit? How do you like it to be served? Apart from your home, where do you get to see this fruit? Students gave various reasons for a particular fruit and various ways of serving that fruit. When this task was discussed in the class, students took many ideas from their peers as well about how different fruits can be served. We took topic favorite fruit after “what I like to do” as it was summer time and students would get various reasons to justify their choices. After discussing this in the class, we moved on to the “Animals”. Some animals were shown to the students and they had to associate some qualities to them. Some of the qualities that they came out with were loving, friendly, sleepy, naughty, etc. In order to record every child’s response a PowerPoint presentation was made and all the responses of the children were recorded. After this a home task was given to the students, where they were asked “if you were an animal what would you be? Why? They had to write a paragraph on this. When students submitted their writings, the reasons that they focused were the qualities/characteristics of that particular animal. They wanted to become like that so that they can also live a life like them. By now, they were looking deep into the qualities or characteristics that define a particular animal. When we discussed the task in the class, few students had chosen similar animals. But, their reasons were different from each other. This is the point where they understood about their uniqueness, their individual choices with the reasons. Next, we took a story named “hamara john” . This story talked about the individual differences and qualities that are intrinsic and these are what makes us different from each other. After reading the story students were asked some questions like-: Did you like the story? Why or Why not? Which character did you like the most and Why? List down some of the qualities of John. What would you have done, if you had found an abandoned egg? The answers that we got from the students were really thought provoking, students did a deep thinking to answer the questions. Here from the story what we wanted to let students think on is how to do things independently. So, the next task students had was to list down things that they can’t do independently, they can do independently now and things that they want to do independently now but are unable to. Once listing was done they were asked to reflect on how they can make themselves independent, students gave great answers like by practising things, by observing how they are being done, etc. From here, we moved to “things that you like to make or create”, students had various things to share and they told various things that they liked to make. All their responses were added in the PowerPoint presentation, where it was visible to everyone and all the students were listening as well as reading each other’s points. Student’s various answers were like-: dance steps, Madhubani paintings, floral decorations, motor fans, etc. after discussing this in the class, the students were given a home task where they had to answer 4 questions that were-: What are some of the challenges you face while making or creating what you like? Are you able to overcome those challenges? If yes, then how? If not, then what are some of the ways to overcome those challenges? The focus here was to ask students that when they create something new, what all difficulties they go through. If there was a challenge or conflict while doing that then how did they resolve it. This activity made students think about conflict and its resolution. We had an immersing discussion around what students have created? what challenges they had faced? and how would they overcome that? Every child was asked one by one and their responses were added to the power point presentation simultaneously. Others could also see the responses and read them as well. After this we moved ahead by asking students what are their individual goals for this year. This made students think in the direction about what they can improve this year. After discussing their goals they were asked, how they were planning to achieve their goals. Students themselves found solutions to their own problems and what they have to do to improve things that they can’t do independently now. Then the focus was brought to the hobbies of the children. In order to make them think about their hobbies, first they were asked what they are good at. Once they got an answer to this question, they were asked what they would do, when they get bored. This made them think about what they like to do the most and what they are good at. We moved ahead in the project by asking students that since these days we all are at home for the entire day, so what do you like the most about being at home? Students gave very bright answers, they mentioned that they were doing things/ activities that wasn’t very frequent to them like spending quality time with family, bird watching, playing with toys, yoga, etc., Then they were asked about their favorite spot in the house, so that we can talk to them about at which place they feel good and peaceful, and they can describe their feelings. Next we started talking about their families and what family means to them. Here, we wanted students to focus on how their personalities are being formed by their family. Moving ahead, the students were asked if they have any pattern in their body and is that symmetrical or not? From there we brought in the concept of horizontal and vertical symmetry, this gave them the awareness of how their body looks like. Then students were asked to write a poem on “Maths in me”. From there, we moved to My body. Now, we started talking about the body. Being aware of oneself is a major part of self awareness. Since we were dealing with 6-7 years of age students, we did quick riddles on guessing the body parts and students were really quick! We integrated the body with mathematics and students were asked to find mathematics around them. Once they were done with this, we asked the students to categorize their body parts into-: Uni, single, one Duo, couplet, two, pair Many, three or more, countable Uncountable Along with categorizing body parts under different heads, they were also seeing synonyms for different words. After completing this they were asked to make a portrait of their body and they had to mark different body parts as uni, duo, many, uncountable. Making a portrait makes the concept clear and gives them a justification of whatever they have categorized is correct or not.

They greeted the children in this morning with this song that surely amazed them with familiar voices of their didi-bhaiyas. The children responded with prolific art works and recorded their wishes throughout the day.\n\n--- Extended Article Content ---\nTeaching-Learning through Projects with Grade 4 Last Year by Yamini Pal | Jul 18, 2020 Prakriti uses project-based learning approach extensively to go beyond the restricted and often incomplete academic understanding to deeper appreciation of concepts. Each project combines the children’s expressions of creativity – verbal as well as written, music as well as dance, art as well as craft, with experiments to observe real-life concepts concretely, collection of factual information, while developing a spirit of curiosity, inquisitiveness, reasoning, logical thinking, and deduction. All projects have elements of hands-on work either related to art, environment or science, to facilitate the development of integrated knowledge of the same. Last year, I worked on about four projects, on an average of six weeks’ duration each with Grade Four. Here I discuss how I went through teaching-learning process on these projects: Me, Myself and My Family: Awareness of self in relation to the social environment, helps an individual to better understand and reflect upon the world around him/her. The project Me and Myself was aimed at developing awareness of one’s emotional triggers, likes and dislikes, a sense of independence and responsibility towards family. From making personalized emotional graphs to exploring gender stereotypes, the project proceeded in a gradual progression from ‘Me’ to ‘Myself’ to ‘My family’. The project created an opportunity for children to form a deeper understanding of each other’s families. Children wrote about what makes a family a “family”, which directed them towards challenging their preconceived notions about a family. They studied varied family compositions, for instance, a single parent family, joint family, a nuclear family and adoptive families. Such activities helped children to build empathy, appreciate and respect cultural and ethnic diversity, and reflect on the fact that each family has to work together to run a household and build a conducive family environment, and is unique and happy! This thought was reinforced through simulation of day to day household activities. Birds: The group embarked on a mission to gather all the knowhow needed to make the transformation from birdwatchers to avid bird admirers! Not only did they get the opportunity to observe the birds in their natural habitat by visiting places like Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary, but they also created opportunities for observation themselves by making bird baths at home. They further explored “What makes a bird a bird?” and identified its various characteristics. From scientifically enquiring how a sound is produced to comparing birds’ beaks with simple machines, the learners went deeper into the process of learning. Throughout the project, they were able to document their detailed observations in the observation sheets, commenting on the types of feet, beaks, tail and feathers. Diversity in Flora: To strengthen the connect with nature, the project Diversity in Flora was initiated. The project started with identification of the unique characteristics of different plants. They categorised the different parts of plants as edible and non- edible. Children were able to break their preconception that every underground part of a plant is a root, when they observed structural differences between bulbs and roots. Children were introduced to characteristic features such as simple and compound leaves, tap and fibrous roots. Through experiments, they could learn how plants take essential elements from the environment, make predictions and corroborate them. Children’s curiosity about what plants do with water and air, probed them to unravel the process of photosynthesis through videos and discussions. My Neighborhood, My City: The project aimed at creating an understanding of neighbourhood and becoming an active participant in identifying the needs of the community. Children explored and observed the components in their surroundings and classified them into categories like houses, facilities, cleanliness, parking and others. Children also explored the use of landmarks and various signage. They mapped their neighbourhood strengthening their mapping skills. They have learned to decipher the components of an address and analysed the meaning and progression of writing an address. Children were asked to identify the pictures of iconic parts of the city, for instance metro, Chandni chowk market, Mall of India etc. In addition to the activity, a famous monument of the city, Qutub Minar was discussed in detail. Children wrote the ‘Tale of Qutub Minar’ personifying themselves as Qutub Minar and expressed the changes that have happened around the monument and in the city over time.

This meant our children programs will stall and fall. Along with this, our parents will not be able to access and sustain behavioural gains and guidance required. In view of the above situation an urgent need to create online support systems was recognised and tireless weekend efforts by the team resulted in the “CRIADIGITAL Program” to be executed across CRIA centres at Shahpur Jat , Gurgaon, Faridabad and the BRIDGE program @ PRAKRITI School. The aim was to Empower and support parents via Providing direct online services to children Parental guidance on programs Behavioral Guidance Webinars This endeavour resulted in Engaging and introducing a new way of interaction. Maintaining gains Moving forward with scientifically well supported guidance Supporting and problem-solving as needed for the whole family of parents,children and their social partners aka therapists. Automated zoom usage and information channels were created overnight and starting on Monday the 23rd April 2020, the 6 session pilots per center transformed into a 100+session support in 5 days. This will bloom into its 300+ sessions and multifold floor hours from the coming week. The extension of curfew on Monday evening for 21 days has further justified the sleepless hours spent on developing the “CRIADIGITAL Program” @ BRIDGE and CRIA centers at shahpurjat, gurgaon and faridabad. This herculean task has minor glitches which are being ironed out gradually. The parents feel supported and therapists are super excited to be back with their children and some children ecstatic to have their besties back in their lives …notwithstanding across the screen !!\n\n--- Extended Article Content ---\nPrakriti Goes Green on Energy by Prakriti | Aug 19, 2020 Prakriti has commissioned a solar energy plant mounted on its building facade .

The programme included several stimulating experiences such as a Film Appreciation Club, Book Reading Circle, Chess Skills, Story and art sessions, Latin Jazz as well as method theatre through Play a Tale. The details of the programmes are as follows. We had participation from over 100 children about 40% of which were outside of Prakriti. The parents and learners have provided glowing feedback to the quality of the programme that we would like to share. Anek Ramayan : In this 10 hour Online workshop, our eminent storyteller Ms. Jaishree Sethi, shared folk stories culled from different Ramayanas existing across India, She also taught new words from different languages like Marathi, Hindi, Bengali through these stories, while our reputed artist-Shri Ramlal Bhatt, made intriguing regional crafts themed on Ramayana. It was a lesson to learn new words, new stories and crafts; and yet go back and learn an age old culture. Film Appreciation : We watched 8 movies before our online meetings. We met in a small group of at most 15 students for 60 minutes, 8 times over a month, for young learners to express their expressions and learning. We watched Arrietty, The Lorax, Blue Umbrella, My Name is Kalam, The Little Prince, Free Willy and Kiki’s Delivery Service. Naveen Vasudevan, a cultural enthusiast and an Auroville resident conducted the workshop and engaged children in an open and fearless dialogue. Prakriti Book Club : We read the two books online with Ms Meenakshi Puri, English language facilitator (ex Sardar Patel Vidyalaya) and a litterateur. In this book reading circle of 4 weeks, the facilitator traversed with young learners into the lives of the characters in these books and cultivated a life-long love for reading different genres. The members of the club read Look into my Eyes by Lauren Child and A Village by the Sea by Anita Desai. I Can… : Prakriti Day Care team has curated a creative combination of Non-Fire Cooking, Creating Crafts, Playful Workouts for our young ones. Children enjoyed the fun of working independently with two activities each day. Play a tale : This role play/theatre workshop was organised by Prakriti in collaboration with Third Space Collective. Our practices relied on *Social Emotional Learning (SEL)* and the *creative field of performance arts* to explore the intricacies of the world through drama with children of all ages, especially in trying times such as these. Our learners understands how to manage emotions, set and achieve positive goals, feel and show empathy for others, manage and establish positive relationships and make responsible decisions. The attribute to articulate well, will make their personalities shine as they grow up. Prakriti Chess School : Strategic games require the players to use autonomous decision-making skills, while providing continuous stimulation to their brain cells. Indeed ! Exercising the brain is as imperative as exercising the body. We organised a Chess Foundation course of 8 classes and 4 tournaments, coached by International Masters CRG Krishna and Mila Zarkovic. Dance in Summer : Prakriti Team collaborated with Gilles Chuyen, french dancer and choreographer for 12 classes across 6 weeks to train learners in Modern Dance on the theme of Nature and Latin Jazz. To make the class exciting for the learners, it began with gentle warm-up exercises and body isolation followed by the choreography. Dancers wanted to move freely and naturally, so they set themselves free from pointy shoes and grasp the floor with bare feet. Dance gave expression to their inner feelings. How beautiful indeed! Stories and Crafts : Prakriti has been organising reading picnics with purposeful stories that fuel imagination and build connections with nature. This summer, for our young children, we had come up with a Stories + Craft workshop. The focus was five elements of Earth, Water, Fire, Earth and Air. We aimed to appeal to the senses of the children around these elements, by shaping ideas. With an eminent storyteller Vasudha Ahuja – a certified storyteller from Kathala, this was a highly enriching experience for all our participants. Vasudha Didi takes our little bundles of joy into a world of imagination and engages them with art, craft and new learnings. Code and Build : Our young learners enjoyed the coding and building sessions. Learners were introduced to Mobile Programming, 3D Design and Modelling and Web Programming. In each module learners started and completed micro projects like Paint your photo app, Mole mash app to name a few. Aayansh's aquarium ??thank you for the activity Inara loved the salad. Ate it too.

Kids are totally engrossed (and let me add sheepishly as am I on the side)!” “Dhun's story from Ramayan. These sessions were a great hit. Dhun thoroughly enjoyed the sessions both stories n puppet making. Can these not be extended till holidays last” Thank you for taking the children on this experiential journey of movies. Vihaan loved every session. Thank you for the wonderful classes Naveen. It was a great concept and Navya has been enjoying every session. In fact, she always looked forward to the session.

Art is deeper, art has many facets! Art is ceremonial and our history is full of evidences. Art is functional, every chair you sit on , every wall frame you look at serves a purpose.The heritage of traditional art forms are the narrative side of art, bringing in with them centuries old tales handed down not in words but as sculptures of Ajanta and Ellora and likes. And lastly but most radically, art is persuasive.It has the ability to influence behaviors, alter attitudes and impact society at large. It is the mirror of the changing times of a generation with a language of it’s own.With the potential of such ardent impact ,art cannot be treated as an alien entity but as a vital , parallel system of communications. It should be pivoted to intersect with other disciplines flawlessly. At Prakriti we intentionally interpolate varied disciplines with art to help our learners visualize their everyday lives through self expression and reflection. After all, the human brain is wired to notice and respond to visual stimuli. Our iterative process in art enables learners to envision, create, present and respond to their understanding of the world around them structurally and conceptually. In the words of our Art Mentor, Meera George (https://www.meerageorge.com/), “Art is not an extra- curricular activity or a hobby class, often synonymous to a free period. Here, it is the means to bridge what learners absorb from the Sciences, Math, Environmental studies or History through a hands- on visual medium. When the concept of Time is explored in a science class, Salvador Dali’s melting clocks finds inspiration in the minds of our young learners, or when Shapes are discussed in Math, Henri Matisse’s whimsical paper collages lead the exploration in our Art class. Each of our thematic Art study is backed through a carefully planned process based learning to first Introduce, Explore, Develop and finally Present through self- reflection and peer critique. The result- an informed learner with honed skills and the ability to translate anything into Art. After all, Art is nothing but a reflection of the world we live in.” https://prakriti.edu.in/wp-content/uploads/Art-Design-PPt-in-Motion-_Jan-2022_SS.mp4\n\n--- Extended Article Content ---\nA study visit to Red Fort : Grade 9 by Prakriti | Mar 23, 2022 Trip to Red Fort was undertaken this month to understand the siege of 1857 and enable the learners to connect with the theme they are studying currently. Historical trips can make history come alive through an understanding of the art, culture and architecture. It also enables the viewer an insight into geo- politics and other finer details by comparing past to present. It is a whole package to learn new things in various dimensions.Certain topics like oppression ,rebellion, abolition, freedom which cannot solely be explained through words can be experienced through visual creation on site. History is not a monolithic narration of the past, but rather a playground of multiple interpretations and scope for diverse interpretations of the past in light of multiple evidences and sources ranging from literary, architectural and oral histories. This half-day study tour aims to help students engage in thoughtful interpretation of diverse sources to challenge various historical misconceptions. Students are expected to analyze a variety of sources like maps, paintings, contemporary primary sources, artifacts that present alternate voices and perspectives of the past. Some observations & inferences: History is written by the victor and can be challenged Historical events are a result of multiple factors. Historical narratives have led to creation of modern day city landscapes Impact of 1857 on Delhi as a city and British as the new ruling class. Learners also saw the trip from an art and design perspective. There were many different types of architecture with contrasting Indian and British influences. Here are a few glimpses of the day. https://prakriti.edu.in/wp-content/uploads/Trip-to-Red-Fort-_March-20222.mp4\n\n--- Extended Article Content ---\nFoundational Learning: Sports Skills by Prakriti | May 11, 2022 April was the time to work on body strength by focused working on a single sport everyday.

They must be encouraged to inertly foster a higher degree of collaborative task management, exercise their understanding through observational learning while balancing and navigating through excessive information download. In our endeavor to motivated young learners and forge in quest to inquire, systematically research, and learn to assimilate their learnings, our end-of-the-season theme “Homes” made an interesting point. The theme invariably imbued an overwhelming response from amongst our Grade 2 group children who explored varieties of home styles, structured models from an assortment of materials for creating homes, explored animal habitats, and constructively explored Google Earth to find houses in different parts of the world. Interpretation of the word – HOME Learners were encouraged to interpret the meaning of home/house as per their understanding and comfortably share their favorite spots/ moments/ conversations they could recall. This exercise helped them collectively to take short trips into the lives of their cohort and discover more about each other on a personal level, something that had been a miss owing to the pandemic. Unusual Homes The continued conversations led to the discussions over the ownership of one’s space, e.g: Who maintains it, how they contribute to it in their everyday lives, and the same in the larger context of community living. Facilitators divulged in expanding their understanding of home structures in geographical and historical contexts at this point too.For example : Cycladic houses take their name from the Cyclades, a group of islands in Greece’s Aegean Sea. The pure white exterior — traditionally achieved with a lime whitewash — creates the distinctive look and helps reflect the hot summer sun. Plus, the lime acts as a natural disinfectant.Source : Google Similarly ,a unit from Cambridge titled ‘Tales from around the World’ was introduced at this juncture, wherein learners were engaged in identifying the physical features and habitats of different animals/birds that may have had influenced their eventual habitat design. Describing words was introduced through an assortment of images to persuade them to create prose/ riddles from the learning and present them elective.For example the “The House of Hair – Jordan”, may sound strange however this very unique form of housing – the Bait Al Shaar, or house of hair is created by the Bedouins and is a labor of love by Bedouins women, who are single-handedly responsible for producing the tent onsite, starting with making thread out of sheep/goat hair and then weaving the thread into fabric before finally sewing the sheets of fabric into a tent.Source: Gulf News My Future House: A project A project -based engagement to propel learners imagination and forge into creativity. As the name suggests, learners were encouraged to think organically; and place themselves in conditions less experienced.From it they were directed to either creatively write or draw the personal aspirations for their “Dream Homes”. Here are a few snippets. The final presentation was ,by each learner wherein he /she presented a homes style from a specific region and its salient features which make it extremely unique and ideal for the stated locations.Exploration with Google Earth saw learners educating themselves and their batch mates of various types of homes from around the world and diving deeper into the architectural features. Mongolian Ger Fujian Tulou Hanok House Bird House Reed House The fear of over load of information specially amongst the younger generation is real however if this very technology is mindfully utilized it will continue to play a vital role in building the future by creating opportunities for widespread communication and collaborative outcomes.",

The four basic steps of making a movie were introduced to the children one after the other: concept, scripting, shooting, and editing. First, The children understood the purpose of film making with visual demonstration. Gradually they developed a concept in a proper screenplay format. What is their movie about? Is it a fictional story or a true one? Is it a comedy or a drama? Will you need actors? What story are you trying to tell? These questions and more were answered while developing the concept for the movie. Then, they created a script with a beginning, a middle, and an end. Also, part of the scripting process is storyboarding. Storyboarding is where you lay out in a sequence of pictures what the audience will see and hear in the movie. Then, you shoot your movie. Following the storyboard, you get the shots you need. So the understanding of shots and camera angle, the prominence of shots, equipment used and required in film making were introduced to the children then comes the editing. Editing is where they put all of the pieces together to produce the final product. Different softwares and their respective use cases were taught. After all of the steps have been completed, their movie was ready to be shown to friends and family and even a public audience. As Spielberg said “EVERY TIME I GO TO A MOVIE, IT’S MAGIC, NO MATTER WHAT THE MOVIE’S ABOUT.” So all their work was magic.

We had organised a Book Reading Club on The Last Gambit (Om Swami), a knowing and chanting session on Vedic Mantras and hands-on sessions on Experiential Mathematics. The feedback from the workshop participants has been been heart-warming. Book Club: We read the books online with Ms Meenakshi Puri, Prakriti’s English language facilitator (ex Sardar Patel Vidyalaya) and a litterateur. Besides interpreting the book, the learners understood how to listen, draw out personal opinions and disagree without resorting to emotional arguments. The Last gambit by venerable monk, Om Swami was an ideal selection for the middle schoolers who have big, hairy, audacious goals and go through the tumult of applying self-discipline and choosing the right mentors to realise their dreams. Power of Mantras: In this eight-part knowing and chanting workshop, the participants learnt the differences between vedic hymns and mantras from ancient texts and understood the relevance and meaning of the verses. They chanted as a daily and built their repertoire, The workshop was facilitated by the erudite Mukul Dwivedi, Prakriti’s mentor for Sanskrit language learning. Power of Mantras Math lab : We did exciting mathematical experiments with Saurabh Suri, a teacher, researcher and social worker. The ten days of engaging sessions covered the world of polygons and polyhedrons, fractions, measurements and numbers. Through concrete materials, the participants deepened their understanding of the concepts and dabbled in mathematical creativity much beyond the limits of the workshop.\n\n--- Extended Article Content ---\nVirtual Science Fair by Prakriti | Mar 17, 2021 Our learners of Grade 6-8 presented their observations in Science through their experiments and creative ideas in a virtual science fair.

The children from the grades: Joy (Grade 1), Rainbow (2) and Sunrise (3) took part in Music POL with great enthusiasm. We were apprehensive of doing a musical performance in the online mode but that went away quickly as recorded videos came to our rescue. Some of the children also performed live and their renditions were a treat to watch. The POL began with a mesmerizing performance by Rajat Bhaiya (Music Facilitator) who played a beautiful tone on flute. We then went ahead with the Live and Recorded performances by the children. The children had performed on the songs they had been practicing in the Music sessions. It was fascinating to see them singing songs and playing flute on songs such as Jingle Bells, 500 miles, Hum honge kamyaab, Paayo ji maine ram ratan, Meera bhajan and so on. The children participated in the POL with zeal and zest and made the POL more lively. The day ended with a few surprises as some impromptu performances came our way which was a feast to our eyes and ears.

Celebrating the anniversary of our Green School prize at NYC’2024Prakriti SchoolOct 07, 20254ShareSaving the planet is a tall order and is a rather egoistic claim. Human activity has breached most ecological boundaries that once ensured the stability of our planet. We can at best save ourselves from natural disasters by taking critical measures. Unchecked industrial expansion, deforestation, carbon emissions, and the overexploitation of natural resources have destabilized ecosystems and accelerated the global climate crisis. The consequences—rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the degradation of air, water, and soil—make clear that humanity can no longer afford to design its built environments in disregard of nature. Educational institutions, in particular, carry a responsibility to embody sustainability in both form and function. School buildings must therefore be conceived as models of environmental harmony: incorporating natural light and ventilation, conserving energy and water, and reducing their ecological footprint. Such architecture does not merely mitigate environmental damage; it also imparts to learners a vital lesson—that human progress is sustainable only when it is aligned with the principles and limits of the natural world.Our campus exemplifies this vision, and the “Green School Award” served as a welcome recognition of our commitment to using thoughtful design and innovative practices for the benefit of both learners and the planet.Click here to read about itWe designed our school to be a living classroom, where every feature, from its natural ventilation to its water recycling systems, teaches a tangible lesson in environmental stewardship. It's a place where students don't just learn about sustainability – they experience it daily.Here's an inside look at what makes our green school a unique and impactful space:Designed for Natural HarmonyOur building's architecture is deeply rooted in principles that connect us with nature and reduce our environmental footprint:Spaces Bathed in Natural Light: Strategically placed windows and skylights fill every learning area with daylight, significantly cutting down on artificial lighting and energy use. This also creates a healthier, more uplifting space for student well-being and focus.Creatively Repurposing Resources: We actively transform discarded materials like plastic and tin cans into functional and decorative items across campus. This practice not only minimizes waste but also cultivates resourcefulness and creativity in our community.Harnessing Solar Power: A significant portion of our energy comes directly from the sun. Our campus is equipped with 50KW capacity of solar panels, a substantial contribution towards our total 90KW energy requirement. This investment in renewable energy drastically reduces our carbon footprint and serves as a powerful, visible example of clean energy in action for our entire community.Green Corridors & Breathing Walls (Ancient Wisdom): Our green corridors act as wind tunnels, enhancing natural ventilation and airflow throughout the school. Classrooms feature green balconies, tended by students, connecting them to living systems. The building itself \"breathes\" using Vedic plaster (lime and cow-dung) and embedded clay pots for natural ventilation. This ancient wisdom helps regulate indoor temperatures, boosting cooling, reducing mechanical system reliance, and promoting a healthier, thermally stable environment.Innovative Cooling for Comfort and EfficiencyOpting for an intelligent, sustainable cooling solution over energy-intensive air conditioning, our school uses an extensive 180,000 CFM evaporative cooling system. This choice provided significant benefits, saving 50% in Capital Expenditure (Capex) during construction and an impressive 90% in Operational Expenditure (Opex) year over year, compared to the 600 tones of conventional AC a building of our size would typically require.Even with our 1.80 lakh sq ft covered area, we consciously utilize only about 60%, leaving Levels 3 and 4 unused to optimize energy. Our system ensures 20 fresh air exchanges per hour, maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal zone of 24.7-33 degrees Celsius in Delhi's climate. While there might be noticeable warmth during 5-7 days of peak humidity in July, this minor trade-off provides six months of consistent fresh air, highlighting our body's natural adaptability.Advanced Air Quality and Energy ManagementBeyond natural ventilation, we ensure optimal air quality and efficiency through advanced systems, notably direct-contact air washers. These units offer exceptional benefits compared to traditional cooling coils.Unlike traditional systems, Air washers achieve remarkable energy savings through efficient heat and moisture exchange. A typical 20,000 CFM air washer unit requires only 1.43 hp (1.07 kW), a stark contrast to the 8.22 hp (6.13 kW) of a comparable conventional system. This efficiency stems partly from their lower air-side pressure drop (0.82 in.H2O vs. 2.26 in.H2O).Crucially for a school environment, air washers also serve as powerful air purifiers. They are effective at filtering 95% of particles larger than 5 microns, including dust, pollen, and even agglomerated microorganisms, ensuring that the air our students breathe is remarkably clean. Furthermore, our air washer system’s water treatment utilizes dissolved ozone, a powerful biocide that purifies the water without the need for traditional chemical additives like chlorine, aligning perfectly with our goal of a chemical-free learning space.These units are also remarkably space and cost-efficient. A typical air washer unit has a capital cost of around $4,000 (approximately INR 3,34,000 in today’s terms, based on data from 2003), significantly less than the $25,000 (approximately INR 20,87,500 in today’s terms) for a traditional coil, and its compact size and lighter installed weight (524 kg vs. 2414 kg for coils) contribute to overall building efficiency.Sustainable Materials and Water ManagementCrucial decisions made during the construction phase laid the groundwork for our sustainable operations:AAC (Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) Construction: We chose AAC blocks for their superior environmental benefits. Made from recycled fly ash with low water consumption, their lightweight nature minimizes waste and transport emissions. AAC’s excellent thermal insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling energy needs, also enabling faster, non-toxic construction and improving indoor air quality.Water Recycling with STP: Our integrated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) recycles all wastewater for use in washing bays and for flushing toilets, including waterless urinals. Separate domestic and STP water lines ensure hygiene while maximizing reuse.Extensive Rainwater Harvesting: Our campus captures and replenishes rainwater with large tanks preventing flooding during heavy downpours. Four recharge wells (two each of 4.5m and 6m diameter) are designed to handle Delhi/NCR’s wettest July rainfall (237mm), effectively protecting and replenishing the aquifer.Learning Beyond the Classroom WallsFarming as a part of Curriculum: Students in Grades 2-5 engage in year-round farming, directly connecting their environment curriculum with practical lessons in soil preservation and resource consciousness. They don't just read about agriculture; they experience the food cycle firsthand, from planting seeds to harvesting produce.Click here to read more about farming curriculum hereMeasuring Food Waste and Composting: We actively teach responsible consumption and the value of resources. Students diligently measure their food waste, which is then collected and sent for vermicomposting. This process transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, completing the cycle and educating students about waste reduction and the benefits of composting.Purpose Projects: Our middle school learners are being encouraged to observe, question, and find innovate solutions to problems emanating from lifestyle choices in the Purpose Projects that commence this year. Mannan: Our commitment to a sustainable future culminates annually in Mannan/मनन, our vibrant festival celebrating sustainability, enterprise, and community. This event is a dynamic platform where learners, parents, and local partners showcase innovative, eco-friendly ventures, such as home-made chemical-free soaps and upcycled crafts. Click here to read more about MannanA Campus Enriched by Nature's BountyOur landscape is a vibrant testament to our commitment to biodiversity and natural beauty. Our campus is home to a rich variety of native trees, including Amaltas, Jamun, Aam, Shehtoot, Ber and Neem. This natural tree cover provides essential shade, contributes to passive cooling, supports local ecosystems, and will eventually offer edible fruits, further integrating our environment into daily life.A Living Legacy for a Greener TomorrowOur campus is a living lesson in sustainability. The green building—from its eco-conscious design and innovative cooling systems to the learning spaces—is central to our educational philosophy. This commitment extends beyond our walls, with events like Mannan fostering a community focused on mindful living and entrepreneurial environmental solutions.We are not just educating students; we are empowering them as conscious global citizens with the knowledge and values to build a healthier, more sustainable future. A school building should be more than just walls and classrooms. It should be an integral part of the learning experience, a testament to our values, and a model for sustainable living.This monsoon, we had the distinct privilege of spending a day with visionary educator Mr. Sonam Wangchuk and Ms. Geetanjali Angmo. In thoughtful conversations with our leaders, they generously shared ideas around sustainable living, eco-friendly practices, and the importance of building with nature rather than against it. From reducing our reliance on air conditioning to using design elements like wind channels and greenery for natural cooling, their dialogue was insightful and deeply relevant to our mission.4SharePrevious",
